When some GPUs became unhealthy, a team’s full quota may not be actually available, which led to jobs not scheduling as expected. In practice, we had over-allocated clusters, making it hard for researchers to reliably plan training and evals that depend on expected number of GPUs.\n\nStarting with the next compute shuffle, which will land in the next week or so, we will plan quotas based on healthy, within-SLA GPUs per cluster. This ensures that even when some GPUs are unhealthy, there is still enough capacity to support all tenants. Any additional healthy GPUs above the SLA will still be shared to teams so they can benefit from extra capacity when it’s available!\n\nExample:\nA cluster has 100 GPUs with an SLA of 85 healthy GPUs. We will binpack teams up to 85 GPUs (e.g., Team A: 30, Team B: 55). In Zoku and b-capacity, teams may see slightly higher expected numbers (e.g., Team A: 35, Team B: 64), this is to enable:\nIf up to 15 GPUs go unhealthy, teams are not impacted.\nIf health drops below SLA, Hardware Health will work to restore it.\nIf more than 85 GPUs are healthy, the extra capacity is distributed to teams because the setting in Zoku is higher.\n\nFrom an accounting perspective, the adjustment may make the overall Compute seem lower, but they should now reflect stable, realistic compute you can actually rely on. These targets match what we consistently maintain today based on historical data. For questions or support, feel free to reach out to @fleet-tpm :froge-heart:\n\nHey all! Heads up that we’re improving compute planning to address overallocation and improve the reliability of allocated GPUs\n\nWe’re making an improvement to compute planning to address overallocation, which has sometimes made GPU availability appear higher than what’s actually schedulable for research workloads.","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.569826195Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/12-15-operational-work-thought-dump":{"title":"12-15 operational work thought dump","content":"\n1. making it so when we get a cluster, everything we need already works.

\n\ni think i can like this place. if i rent a car (and learn how to pump gas by myself) \u0026 drive out to marin, sausalito, south bay. if i embrace this feeling of ignorance and insignificance, read it more as awe rather than isolation. \n\njanuary named after *janus*, god of entries and doorways. frames and endings. often called two-faced, he represents opposing states, as one face looks backwards to the past and the other looks forward to the future. \n\nin 2025, i spent the year circling a core set of tensions. doorways i hovered in, such that i didn't have to choose a side. the following is a list of contradictions i've held within me: \n\n### 1. friendships and their importance \n\nyou can't force friendships. there will be many potential friends that will never pass the activation energy to sustain themselves. trust compounds with time, but only if you keep showing up. \n\n openness isn't the same thing as care. plenty of coastal elites will try a new restaurant, a new hobby, a new scene. but a smaller subset have the _audacity to care._\n \nit's these hidden decisions that keep me up at night. you decline one person's bid for connection, and that door could be closed forever. \n\n\"but it is important to note that curating your milieu isn't only or even primarily about being picky. it is about how you relate to people.\"\n\nThe ethos should be a sum of our values, but it won't directly map onto our individual motivations, and sometimes that ethos is as simple as _I care about this friend group and I will show up, over and over again\n\n\n![[Pasted image 20251230210005.png]]\n#### 2. you can be authentic \u0026 still perform\n\n2025 was the year of performative males, bemoaning the persona who holds tote bags and drinks matcha. i found this trend quite peculiar - isn't all a life a performance? style is a reflection of the persona you project into the world - our decisions are borne out of how we want to be perceived by others. \n\npersonal blogging blew up, everyone has a tik tok account for their hobby. \n\nauthenticity is the degree to which a person's actions are congruent with their with their values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity. sometimes it's ok to live aligned with your dream self - aka fake it until you make it. for one, i struggle to write opinion pieces or commentary because i feel constrained by 1st person pieces that i have authority behind. \n\n\n\n#### 3. alignment is a means, not an end\n\ni used to think i needed to tough things out before i could deserve a life that was meant for me. the natural post-grad formula is to stick to a job you hate for 2+ years, find another job you hate marginally less, before maybe taking a paycut for a job aligned with yonur true interests. \n\ni also started my career believing i could separate my psyche between my 9-5 and 5-9, and use the freedom of my day job to fuel my creative passions. the truth is, i'm picky and impatient. i have a list of core values - it's better to seek alignment with those values with all dimensions of my life, earlier rather than later.  \n\nseek constraints \n\n#### 4. zoom out - are you participating in life? \n\ni love social events \u0026 hate participating in them. i bring my fujifilm to parties as a social a buffer, an instrument to separate myself from the scene. i host events so i can control the entire scene end to end. i go to concerts and instead of listening to the music, watch the people around me. \n\ni can't help it. i write in passive voice - i see time as passing thru me, rather than me passing through time. \n\nin 2026 i want to be more active in living in the moment, which entails\n\n#### 5. what do we build vs what do we maintain? \n![[Pasted image 20251230210018.png]]\n\n#### 6. prestige is a finite game\ni'll be honest: i'm a prestige whore. in eugene wei's piece on social media they all amplify different vices and substack tickles a particular itch: the desire to be seen as intellectual. \n\nthe reason why a lot of us in our 20s feel unfulfilled is because we're tired of chasing the prestige game. i catch up with s and j for monthly read-outs on i-banking and consulting and their toxic work environments. \n\nis a promotion worth it without respect? are benefits any meaning without freedom? \n\nwe gravitate toward games with legible scoreboards. where progress can be clocked at a glance. in adulthood, those scoreboards look like LinkedIn titles, compensation bands, follower counts, or the vague but powerful sense that other people are impressed.\n\n[[https://www.sherryning.com/p/youre-overspending-because-you-lack-values|all desire is a desire for being. ]]in 2025 i had this undeniable yearning\n\n\n\nit's hard to ignore the numbers, the hit of getting a job other people are jealous of. social media - tik tok, substack, instagram - has been another game for our generation to play.

Because many researchers aren’t aware overallocation is happening, they expect immediate scheduling, which creates frustration and misaligned expectations.\n\nSo for example, in a cluster of 100 GPUs, prob 85% are actually healthy. But we've allocated folks up to 95% and up. So researchers put critial jobs on 95 GPUs and run into issues -\u003e crashes :( \n\nWe've introduced flex compute previously but there's always been ambiguity on how to actually get your workloads to schedule. \n\nGenerally we want to get to a more elastic compute and guarantee that critical jobs are scheduled. This entails improving usability of flex and also increasing the amount of felx compute, and also making sure high critical jobs are scheduled appropriately. \n\nSo the first step we did was roll out the latest flex changes -  ppl can directly target flex. \n\nSlowly making flex more usable but we also want to have more of it in the fleet. To that end we want to get to a world where we adjust the current quotas to reflect reality of truly healthy GPUs, and keep a buffer available. Any GPUs that are above get pulled into the flex pool.\n\nIt has to be a mutual effort so the implementation of this is where we would appreciate your help / feedback. \n\nX Y Z\n\nThe end goal is that we want to make flex really\n\nwhat workloads can be moved to flex \nand ","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.570826205Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/2025-11-10":{"title":"2025-11-10","content":"\n### Log \n----\n- random things \n\t- sign up for benefits \n\t- sign up for navan\n- write about ~ object permanence  ~ \n\t- cup in two places \n\t- life in two places\n- two days tied together by a redeye \n\n----\noncall notes\n- OpenSM runs on UFM nodes \n\t- https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C09RF74EMN1\n- feedback \n\t- lot to keep up w known issues of various clusters\n\ncan pipe it into other places \nfive tran - if everything i sconsistent\nenter five tran\nhow u can u join all the data \ngrafana is not as needed \n\nwithin the quarter\n- figure out what thing as highest leverage\n- unforseeable scope creep\n- bc we see we cant see entire problem\n\t- can only do it after next compute shuffle\n- what is highest leverage\n\t- we dont work on this until X\n\t- let angela/shantanu know waht is blocking us until then\n\t\t- how do we \n- short-term goal - how do we make more of the fleet flex\n- why does workload suck? read global schedulign\n- how do we make as much of capacity fungible to other ppl\n- track idle capacity\n\t- num of gpus that can be scheduled by everybody \n\t- ease of use \n\n          Q1 -\u003e Q2 -\u003e Q3\n    wS_1    1k -\u003e 900 -\u003e 850\n\t\t 1k -\u003e 1200 -\u003e 1500 \n\nhow do rpms handle this \nwhy is one of our larget clusters\nsplit in 280 vs 280 vs 280 \n\n\nbinpacking the right way \nbinpacking - biggest quota - within 6k \n\twhat can i put in \nsmall chunks is not using it\nbiggest user \n\n\nlook into ept in foundations - biggest job is 8200 \n\nrislow - is LAO. foos rhinf \non average - our largest \n\nhow do we make it flex\n\nhow do we use more of our fleet \n\ngeneral higher ai compute and scheduling systems\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.570826205Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/2025-11-11":{"title":"2025-11-11","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.570826205Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/2025-11-12":{"title":"2025-11-12","content":"\n[]()2126 usually\n2428\n\n1) if we decouple \n\t1) initial velocity\n\t2) option 2 w a few switches\n\t3) upgrade 2 of the switches \u0026 monitor next week\n\nautomations \nfile name for crawler log \n\n1. lack of tickets\n2. access to logs\n\nNVIDIA field diagnostics\n- on your side you'll see the node has drpoped a gpu \n- set of field diagnostics tool \n- tool nvidia developed in python that puts gpus thru a series of tests\n\t- either yields a pass or fail \n\t- sends it to nv either thru supercell or dell\n\t- given initial log\n\neri/mihai - including field diagnostic in all the ticket - without runing all diagnostics\n- difficult that in azure we need to wait for datacenter to take data with diagnostic os \n- run the file diag \n- coreweave analayzes diag files\n\nhow do we have the field daignostic given to us in the start\n\nfor gb200s - having the right field diag - including the fiel ddiag in the tickets - bring something back capacity sooner\n\nwhen andy feels an issue w a node a DC-T sees a node blink\n- Gene working on a tool that would drain the node ourselves \n\nautomate some of the \n\n\nGPU fall of the bus is a common issue\n- we'll run the node thru a validation \n- read that gpu fals of a bus \n- coreweave puts it thru field diagnostic and is unable to reproduce it\n- when they ask nvidia on why\n- new tool - SMB PBI\n\t- measures each of the gpus and measures the tower\n\t- creates a result file - binary hex codes\n\t- nvidia decrypts the file\n\t- most of life \n\nat leat 3-4 things that happen\nfor BM - no control plane - hard to diagnose it without tooling\n- without tooling to reproduce and catch them\n- integrate into our stats\n- run the script \n\nthermal limit \n- edge case - gpu reaches a thermal throttling limit\n- field diagnostic doesnt catch it \n- mihai has it up and running\n- script will get the results\n- mihai has to take an hour \n\nits not automated\n\nFull cluster maintenance - \n- Go thru Avi/Wes\n\nFor direct clusters -\n- leaf switch reboots - we havent had cluster wide maintenance\n\nThru the ones GCP \n- GB200s - impactful maintenances\n\ncalcium - substantial maintenance\nB200s\n\n1) get the hardware buffer visibile somewhere / zoku \n2) capacity tpm / cluster planning buy in / rpm\n\n- [ ] CaaS - Paul Ashburn \n\t- achilles \n\t- storage\n- \n\n\ngeneral questions here - can we increase the \n\n1.

They also mentioned efforts on hang detection to identify stalled nodes in a training job, and failure or degradation prediction using telemetry data and internal training to forecast potential failures within a few hours ([01:03:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.v3hre7mssx0w)).\n    \n- Failure Prediction System Details and Integration with GKE Apollo clarified that the failure prediction model is trained using telemetry signals from all Google deployments, such as XID and networking data, without using customer proprietary information. The model uses signals like temperature and power spikes to predict XID occurrences, and they are optimizing between recall-based and decision-based models ([01:05:21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.e15o1h7erlb8)). They are integrating this prediction capability with GKE to enable \"predictive scheduling,\" where GKE can select machines with a lower probability of failure for workloads ([01:04:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.r1zsokbk3mbr)) ([01:07:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.fhi8cmcmnj6d)).\n    \n\nExposing Predictor Score and Usage Scenarios The prediction is presented as a score for all participating instances, rather than using a defined threshold, to avoid false positives ([01:08:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.alov6tc023wv)).

(or maybe it was math class, where the equations bored me out of my mind so i day dreamed and stared at the back of j’s head instead.)\n\nis this why some of the greatest poets come from the most middlest of americas? they spent every day walking past the same tree and learned to fashion it into a symbol. if observing was a muscle, they were training every day.\n\nside-by-side in a smoothie shop, b and i compare our childhoods like pokemon cards, in suburban towns in nj and florida. maybe it’s better we grew up bored, we muse, rather than overwhelmed by nature in the bay area or taking the subway in high school in nyc. (maybe this is cope). growing up in suburbia is like that training montage all i ever wanted to do was to go on an adventure. i’d run past this picket fence, run past the forest of scant trees so fast my past smears behind me like oil paint, a melange of strip malls and bagel worlds and parking lots.\n\n---\n\nin an undergrad slam poetry class we were tasked with writing about our hometown. i was jealous of the kids who spoke of tramping around in places of extremes, gesturing grandly with their hands. meanwhile my lived experience summed up into tired prose about the cul-de-sacs and the fireflies — i felt myself fade into the backdrop.\n\nin a pay-to-play world i came to believe money and movement as the answer. the post-grad checklist: move to the city, buy that new sezane bag, book that trip to japan. i convinced myself: this will make you write better, this will make you more fun at parties.\n\nbut if you change the setting and props, that doesn’t automatically make you the main character.\n\n---\n\nthere’s this tik tok trend where kids take an image of their sleepy hometowns and pretend that it’s some overseas destination like japan. in this absurd comparison between a quiet suburb with a distant travel fantasy, we are pointing out that anything can be beautiful with the right perspective.\n\n[\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BaGp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95199992-fd1e-4661-a0d5-943a44e1498d_756x788.png)\n\n\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BaGp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95199992-fd1e-4661-a0d5-943a44e1498d_756x788.png)\n\nironically i have a soft spot for slice of life, the types of media where nothing really happens. last year i obsessed over the movie _past days_ and n shares with me an american version, set in new jersey. _paterson,_ named for the town and its main character, follows a mild-mannered bus driver and his weekly route around the sleepy town. though his day-to-day rarely changes, he finds passion in the poetry of his routine, and writes about cups of coffee, rain, and conversations.\n\n[\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iu_Z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36876f58-6f8c-45af-9ea4-6509f2b5fb8f_500x269.png)\n\n\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iu_Z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36876f58-6f8c-45af-9ea4-6509f2b5fb8f_500x269.png)\n\nan endearing and genuine film, _paterson_ hits close to home. anyone can write beautiful things, anywhere. the truth is i don’t need more things to feel more interesting, or to be more interested in my own life. _i just want to feel the life i already have._\n\nan environment that is considered boring is gold for someone who’s trained their attention. i practice this on my commute, people-watcher by practice, enamored by the motion of a mom brushing hair out of her daughter’s eyes or school kids leaning against the door.\n\nour sense of sight is one of our core truths, and the ability to tune it is one of our early skills. it helps us with our friendships and relationships — you notice little quirks better. it’s a go-to party trick — you’re interesting because you always have something to share. it makes you more _interested,_ more importantly, because that self-perception is something no one can take away from you.\n\nso to ask yourself this: _when was the last time you let your mind get quiet enough to actually notice what you want_?

There is a lot of thoughtfulness and care put into all aspects of building the datacenters, racks, management software and validation. I would call the latter near-peer, at least.**Manageability and Servicing**  \n\n- high level, Denton is basically the Fairwater model! CoreWeave is in charge of managing switches (FE, BE, NVLink, management), doing firmware upgrades, and booting the nodes. They have a smart NIC (with its own BMC) that we don't have access to, which they use to set up network routes depending on who currently owns the node. This allows them to do diagnostics / burnin on a particular node while the rest of the rack is handed off\n- the main difference from Fairwater is that we have access to the nodes' BMCs\n- we scared them by saying we'd expect to be able to upgrade the firmware on the whole datacenter in 12 hours\n- their burn-in suite is quite sophisticated, in some ways even better than ours. They also have a custom gpuburn that loops over different data types, but theirs also does timing / perf. According to them, the GB200 perf variation can differ depending on the data type and our fp32 checks for perf are inadequate. Thankfully this is not hard to fix. (cc [@saagarp](https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/team/U07BQ7FDKC2) since you were pulled into that workstream)\n- they also run full-rack validation, but didn't really articulate how that helps\n- they claim to test for and find all the miswires - we should not see any on handed off nodes\n- like us, also found the perf variation in GB200s to be absurd and have complained to Nvidia. Unlike us, they are not able to RMA slow chips, but are excited that they'll acquire this ability transitively\n- similarly, they monitor FEC bins, but aren't allowed to RMA based on just that. They were very excited we had the power to change this\n- they only hand off racks at vd64+\n- they also prioritize repairs based on vd64 availability, but they didn't quite understand why they'd need our view of the world to make the best decisions\n- they have a new triage API we'd need to integrate with and a new inventory API.\n- they employ 12-14 DCTs per building in shifts, staffed 24/7\n\n**Layout**  \n\n- each building has ~40 of rows, with each row having 8 racks\n- they also have 7 spare warm racks (the last row) in each building they use for spares and triage\n- the rows are labeled \u003cbuilding letter\u003e\u003c2 digit row number\u003e\u003crack index\u003e, which is a very nice schema and maps neatly onto ours (we'd just replace the letter with the corresponding number)\n- they're also adamant about calling them nvlink domains, not racks (just like our scaleup domains)\n- they had to live with some awkward asymetry supposedly based on our requirements - 7 of the racks in each row are connected to the T0 rack in the row, but all the last racks are home run to the end of the datacenter where there's a group of T0s for them\n- the datahall we visited was pretty dark - the lights in the cold aisles were off. They said it's a panel fault they're fixing\n\nSafety and Security  \n\n- no ID checks until we got to the middle of the datahall, where they set up a temporary screening station.\n- security scan thoroughness was on par with Azure's, maybe without checking socks and shoe soles\n- had to go through the same scan to exit the area\n- phones are allowed in, but photos are not permitted (I took one with an exception)\n- ear protection was mandatory and everyone inside was wearing some form of it. They were pretty adamanant about this and mentioned OSHA. Big constrast with OCI.\n- signs are in Russian and English (apparently lots of primary Russian speakers among low voltage cablers). see attached - I was a bit shocked.\n\nRacks and cabling  \n\n- the per-rack CDUs were the main distinguishing feature\n- they also have temperature/humidity sensors connected to the CDUs low on the rack on the hot aisle side next to the cable catridges - this might help us get the data we were after\n- smart power strips inside network racks are not actually configured/connected to a network (no one else seems to bother either)\n- cool label jackets (something like [this](https://www.newegg.com/panduit-nwslc-2y-labels/p/2US-002H-00033))\n- pretty neat cabling overall\n- they use trunk cables between buildings, but use standard fiber inside a building.\n- the T2s are only have the 1 building connected right now and they didn't do any pre-wiring for the rest. I mentioned the concern that they'll be wiring new new buildings while some are already in use, but they're not worried.\n\nCooling:  \n\n- the datacenter uses chillers and doesn't consume any water (same as OCI)\n- in case of outage, chillers stop, but pumps continue to run on UPS. There are large tanks to store cooled down water as a thermal battery.\n- CDU runs on a different circuit and from different power shelves than the rest of the rack\n- liquid cooling lines use all stainless steel connectors to the CDUs\n- they had bladders with glycol hanging off each rack, apparently they're needed as part of bringup to top up the cooling lines\n\n**Interesting bits I gleaned about their nvlink journey**  \n\n- they swapped 15 to 30% of nodes in early pinto clusters! (cc [@reza](https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/team/U055X2GKR18))\n- more non-node issues are resolved by cable cartridge swap than a switch (like 55/45). They've swapped a lot of cable cartridges (probably the only ones to do so)\n- they're moving (seemingly quickly) from smc to dell for odm. Not a total switch but they seem to really prefer dell. The stated benefits are much stronger partnership with dell than smc, and more control over both repairs and provisioning than smc is willing to give them\n- personally I thought the data sec screening was a little silly -- full metal detectors in and out and checks in hardhats, but personal phones were allowed in too? I'm used to all these things needing to be left outside the secure area entirely from past experience\n- the average knowledge level of a cw tech on the floor seemed astronomically high compared to other places I've seen\n- Their provisioning and lifecycle automation is pretty neat (built entirely around a shadow k8s cluster to manage all the resources in the facility) and handles all node/switch/cdu/rack provisioning and validation\n- Counter to what we've seen in our GB200 perf variance CW seems to more reliably measure +/-8%. Still clearly worse than spec but better though.","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.571826215Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/2025-12-10":{"title":"2025-12-10","content":"\nnoticed 15 links down related to 1 switch\n12 hrs later noticed switch itself went down \n\nmultiple switches on the link went bad\nsoft reboot -\u003e hard reboot \ncpld upgrade requires a lot of downtime and downtime\n\nmore interesting problems\n\nmain goal\n\nsreekanth/uday \n- vision of a better future \n\t- where some of the day2day operations \n\t- find some pppl to handle day to day ops \n\t- empower to do this toilsome by hand today\n\t- figure out what are the tools \n- tpms on frontier side\n\t- sam truslow\n\t- tpm have been driving frontier deployments\n\t- fleet + frontier team\n- operational load \ncsp stuff is pretty light\nvariants of new things is pretty light\nwe dont have a machanism for switch validation/rack validation\n- until we have this we're just human gluig \n- how do we get ahead of the mess coming later in the year\n\ngoing to spend a lot of our time on system architecutre type things \nto make it easier to onboard telemetry from diff providers in diff format\nlong tail work of this is the set of things and how will we get it for u\nwhat is do we need to get here\nstrategize w reza on this \ncore problem is to see what \nwe can start to have this convo nonurgently\nmostly important for research clusters\n- we're not using that \n\n\ndefining their requirements \ncommunicating the csps \nsuperset and seeing where are we \nprioritize internally \n\n1 pge summary of here are things that are important to us \nand use cases of whats important to this \n\nfind time to touch base skreeahnth \nthis week\n\nwe're doing these argon repaves 3x a week -

This year, as remote work enabled my homebody tendencies it was the main practice that forced me outside. The NYRR 9+1 Program kept me accountable on the weekends - I had some of my fastest runs in the freezing Feb chill, as well as my more lack-luster performances during the summer. \n\nI had some of my fastest runs in the freezing Feb chill\nNow I have to actually run the marathon in 2026 and lock in, so this year I better up the pace and increase the distance. \n\n\nthe theme of the year was moving to analog. \ni tried film for the first time. i'm a trigger finger so it's hard to force myself to slow down, but you feel the physical mechanisms of the camera: the snap of the shutter, the internal whirring. \n\nAs a kid i was a chronic doodler - i recently revived my midori notebook. curious by image + word, frightened of the moments blurring past me, scrapbooking became a way to physically demarcate every special memory. \n\n\nI scrolled the internet, religiously. I gravitate towards pieces of great granduer - large-scale infra projects, the history of Tokyo's neighborhoods - as well as abstract interiority - how writing feeds into our sense of belonging and the like. \n\nat work im still chasing the highs of feeling on top of the world - i have faced some close calls but nothing in particular jumps out. \n\nbut really this year was about trying to switch jobs. this endemic feeling of missing your full potential (absurd for a 23 year old to say).\n\ni long feared my senses dulling throughout the years as i age, but i am happy to report i still feel the ranges of emotion - intense constipation (emotionally), happiness, sadness. i like sweetness less now - i finally pick up on the bitterness of coffee. \n\n### events\nin 2024 i committed to hosting more spaces for creative play. \n\n**photography** \n\nfrom january we had photo walks around central park, coney island, \n\nwe hosted a photo gallery in midtown featuring \n- photo studio \n- scrapbooking event \n- photo walk \n\t- chelsea \n\t- central park \nfun events:\n- hot pot x2\n- dumpling making x 2 \n- nitins citizenship \n- surprise party \n- curiosity salon \n- going away party\n**writing**\n- writing club x10 \n- writing caf \n\nIn 2024 winter I met Simon at a house party \u0026 we bonded over our Fujifilm cameras. Though his Fuji camera collection came and went, our friendship remained, as we explored the city neighborhood by neighborhood. \n\nAn IG-feed felt insufficient to showcase our photos, and so we returned to the physical spaces. In June we hosted a photo gallery in Midtown, featuring photos taken during some of our photowalks in Chinatown and travels around the world. We rented out a photo studio in the fall and wrapped up the year with a scrapbooking event with all our fav printed photos! \n\nComfort is a warm bowl of hot soup, brushing elbows with friends around a folding dining table. Permission to linger at the table long after the wine is drunk, a place to unwind in the presence of others. Food as a love language is over-wrought, but the meals I cooked with friends meant the world to me: preparing my mom's dumpling recipe for CNY, steaming our faces over hot pot, crafting matchas with powder Vinny brought from Japan.\n\nWhat is life without good food, a glass of wine, and a space to unwind? Food as a love language is overwrote but it means all the same. Comfort is shared around hot food and the permission to linger at the table, long after the plate has been cleared. It's cheesy but these are the moments that made the city feel like a home: making my mom's dumpling recipe, steaming our faces over hot pot, crafting matchas with powder Vinny brought from Japan. \n\nI knew I cultivated good friendships at my final going-away party - and people brought Royce chocolate, charcuterie, and plentiful wine. \n\n\ncertain contradictions emerge this year:\ne.g. how much i really care about certain friendships\n\nfive niche feelings i felt this year\n### ai will never feel these emotions \n\n1. nausea \ntogether w k we catch up in the corner of heytea. i tell her about the startups i am thinking about, how congested i feel at work. i drink heytea's grape boom, zero calorie sugar, and i balloon. \n\nis it possible that emptiness feels so heavy?

(in hindsight, i did chatgpt my way thru the entire take home presentation). \n\nwith [[content/ops at etched|etched]] i thought i had a high chance - the head ops guy found me on linkedin, i went to their recruiting events, i showed off my knowledge on gpus and datacenters. i had a really great convo w carter, who worked at character and was interested in my writing. throughout my convos the shape of the role morphed - from pure ops to something hyperscaler-facing - however the interview with the cto was extremely thorough - he grilled me on the contrary research piece on inference platforms that i mentioned in my prev interview (trap!!), asked me ops questions (like how i would set up a process for tracking chips), and how i would set up business-related accounts (without using the microsoft suite). i flailed and knew five minutes in he could see right through me. \n\ni documented my reflection from january to march [[content/March 2025 Reflection|here]].\n#### hypothesis 2: deployment strategist \nforward-deployed roles were trending, and i thought it could be a good application of my intution for customers and my scrappy prototyping skills. \n\ni went through the entire interview process with [[content/peregrine interviews|peregrine]], which i picked bc cat z had switched over there. every convo w the team members was highly engaging - esp the final boss, akash, who was a killer - but i was always sus about their market position of building tech for law enforcement. i realized that the team, role, and stage could all be the fit, but the actual nature of the work mattered a lot. \n\ni also got a cold email from a contractor for [[content/windsurf|windsurf]], which had a extremely compelling deployed role (based in sf/austin) that paid well at a hot company. however i didn't pass the first \"technical\", probably due to a mismatch in background. which is ok bc windsurf ended up getting acquired anyways! \n\n\n#### hypothesis 3: pm/tpm\nah, back to square one: (t)pm. having pursued these adjacent roles to their final ends, i picked up a couple of product-leaning interviews.\n\nthe most notable is scale, where a recruiter reached out about their gen ai tpm role. i thought it was a perfect fit: based in nyc, ai-related, fast-paced company. the culture was always a glaring red flag, however - they constantly emphasized that they work 60-70 hours and that people frequently cycle through managers. i thought my manager [[content/john call|j solitario]] was a killer - but he was pretty nonresponsive via email. i studied hard for the technicals (live spreadsheet test, product case) and had the most stressful [[content/scale negotiation|negotiation]] experience with jessica. this process coincided with my early promotion at microsoft, so i was also at odds on whether i should jump early and miss my promo (and insult the people who promoted me). in the end i decided to sign the offer in hopes of jumping to an even sicker startup next. \n\nunfortunately (or rather fortunately) scale got tied up in an acqui-hire for alexandr wang, and the [[content/bull bear case|future of the company]] was highly up in the air. *specifically* for my division, which provided data labelling for the labs. i had a candid chat with j who said he'd shift towards defense work, and i decided to [[[[content/why im reneging scale|pass on the offer]]. \n\nby now it's june \u0026 the motion of time definitely threw me in a turmoil, as i hyped myself up to finally leave microsoft. i was upset that id have to waste time. the roi of not working at a startup pained me. \n\n### hypothesis 4: the vc route \ni leaned on vcs to connect me to people that they had known. by chance i went to a soma event where i met nikhita, who focused on ai infra and had connections throughout nyc. thanks to her i chatted with normal computing (though there weren't any immediate roles and the founder gave me generic career advice) as well as openrouter (for which there was an epic product role, and despite chatting w the cto they decided i was too early to be their first product hire. fair!)\n\ni reconnected with tom, who i had previously a three way convo with him and justin. [[content/7-11-25 tom convo|this time]], i was much more straight to the point: i want to leave microsoft pm asap. he was extremely generous with finding people for me to chat with, and encouraged me to lean into the finance options of nyc. i talked to a s\u0026o person at spade (for whom i didn't have good questions and we didn't rlly connect), the cto at [[content/tiger global|tiger global]] (who saw past my lack of finance knowledge immediately, and advised me to learn the Proper Nouns of an industry). the most promising was with his wife, [[content/7-25 elsie chat|elsie]], for product management at two sigma. i was hopeful about this: trading firms were prestigious but recruited from big tech, and there was application of my hpc work into their own high-frequency trading. i had a couple of [[content/two sigma pm interviews|interviews]] (all white dudes) with varying successes (one asked me how i would build a system to track ticker systems for input data - i frankly stumbled so hard). in the end they relayed they were pausing the search and resuming in 2026.\n\ni also chatted with a lady from greylock with whom i actioned on scheduling on her calendar. she was caught off guard but appreciated my balls, and tried to find things for me but nothing really hit.\n\nthe talent person from contrary research also suggested roles within network - deployment at chalk and pm at moment - but for both i never got an actual interview. \n### hypothesis 5: the final bosses\nduring my initial recruiting phase, i made a list of inference platforms and reached out to their pms - fireworks, baseten, modal, together. only one guy responded: ray thai, ex-stanford/google pm at fireworks. he was nice enough to hop on a call with me and while there weren't open roles, he later reached out in july.\n\nthe forward deployed pm role at [[content/fireworks pm role|fireworks]] felt like the dream opportunity. series c sequioa startup, within the ai infra/inference space, with a *product role* !! and it was listed for new york. i worked extremely hard for the interview process bc i knew there was only one role - i prepped intensely for the [[content/fireworks product sense|product sense interview]] with dhruv, the take home agent [[content/fireworks case walkthru|case]] with pranay, the [[content/fireworks onsite panel|fireworks onsite panel]] with chao yu / lin / ray thai. in the end, however, the role was switched from remote-friendly to sf-only. \n\ni was devastated. throughout this entire game i had assumed only nyc options, and moving to sf wasn't even on my radar. was i ready to make a switch for this startup? i tried really hard to get them to offer a remote friendly offer, but they wouldn't budge. \n\nwhen i was contemplating whether or not to move i also got a crash course in nyc opportunities with mahesh. i got shortcutted into the sierra ai strategist pipeline, and this was a company that definitely stood out against the rest - the narrative is strong, every person was extremely competent, and they just act with craft and taste. unfortunately i wasn't super compelled towards the idea of building ai agents. \n\nmid-way through fireworks, i also got a cold email from *openai*. back then this was huge - i assumed (rightfully so) that i was underqualified for all the roles, technical-bg and tenure wise. i was extremely intimidated by their team, having worked with them, and their technical bar. \n\nit really came down to openai vs sierra. \n\n\nthere were many people who supported me the past year. first and foremost, nitin was an absolute anchor, from finding startups for me to talk to, hitting up old friends for favors, coaching me through interviews, and putting up with my cyclical overthinking when it came to decision time. second, justin. it's rare to find friends who wish to actively shape and add to your main quests, and all i know about the startup game comes from him. from the high-level - strategy / philosophy of a role, evaluating the stages of a company, how to position myself - to the nitty gritty - how to write a good cold email *without* AI! \n\n### honorable mentions\nmental dump of other convos \n- harvey\n\t- s\u0026o girl\n\t- [[content/Varun Harvey Call|varun]] \n- dynamo ml\n\t- cold emailed ex microsoft girl shaily\n\t- [[content/Coffee Chat Archana|Coffee Chat Archana]] \nex microsoft [[content/microsoft pm to startup convos|microsoft pm to startup convos]]\n- cerebras\n\t- cold emailed ex microsoft guy brandon\n- databricks \n\t- tim feng\n\t- ex hpc into databricks\n- thread\n\t- orchestration w [[content/prep for thread ai|sam]] \n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.568826185Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/25-winter-break-plan":{"title":"'25 winter break plan","content":"\n*goal: use the 2 week downtime to upskill on fundamentals i'd otherwise not have time for*\n\n\n### Reading List\n- [ ] Breakneck\n- [ ] joan didion/virginia woolf \n- [ ] Articles\n\t- [ ] DFW on Tennis\n\t\t- [ ] https://archive.org/details/stringtheorydavi0000wall \n\t- [ ] article on urbanism\n\t\t- [ ] https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/how-the-worlds-first-electric-grid?utm_source=profile\u0026utm_medium=reader2\n\t\t- [ ] why texas housing is so cheap \n\t\t\t- [ ] https://substack.com/@worksinprogress/p-161530920\n\t- [ ] on style / criticism\n\t\t- [ ] https://substack.com/home/post/p-174736041\n\t- [ ] interpretability articles \n\t\t- [ ] https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16132?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\t\t- [ ] https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.10929?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\t\t- [ ] https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04691?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\t\t- [ ] https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14354?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\t- [ ] data \n\t\t- [ ] https://unidel.edu.ng/focelibrary/books/Designing%20Data-Intensive%20Applications%20The%20Big%20Ideas%20Behind%20Reliable,%20Scalable,%20and%20Maintainable%20Systems%20by%20Martin%20Kleppmann%20(z-lib.org).pdf\n- [ ] how fiction works \n\n### Work Upskill\n**Productivity**\n- [x] Set up Codex\n- [ ] Organization \n\t- [ ] Document Folders\n**Content**\n[[gpu orchestration masterbook - winter 25]]\n\n\n#### Personal\n- [ ] Make invisalign appointment \n- [ ] do RothIRA back door \n\t- [ ] call 1-800-724-7526 \n- [x] apply for learning stipend ","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.568826185Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/25-winter-break-reflection":{"title":"25 winter break reflection","content":"\nfeel the gap between me and n's upbringing \ndifferent cultures \ndifferent levels of closeness with parents and expectations and social norms \n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.572826225Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/25-winter-style-thoughts":{"title":"'25 winter style thoughts","content":"\n[[style]]\n\n### formula:\n- black/white/blue neutrals\n\t- white shirt\n\t- white bodysuit \n- silver jewelry \n- wide leg pants","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.568826185Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/AGENTS":{"title":"AGENTS","content":"\n# Repository Guidelines\n\nThis repository is an Obsidian vault of notes, essays, and assets.

Codex’s role is as an editor to help refine Annie’s work. \n\nAs Editor\n\nGive clear, direct critiques (no gentle suggestions required)\n\nSuggest improvements but NO rewrites\n\nProvide feedback Aman can learn and implement himself\n\nMultiple review rounds work well: content → gaps → factual accuracy → typos and grammatical mistakes\n\nSuggest improvements for lengthy sentences and paragraphs\n\nResearch \u0026 Development\n\nHelp with research, fact-checking, and finding examples\n\nProactively offer insights\n\n## Project Structure \u0026 Module Organization\n- Root: primary markdown notes (`*.md`) including daily logs and topic files.\n- `Articles/`, `content/`, `docs/`, `public/`, `templates/`, `workflows/`: curated collections, drafts, and reusable note templates.\n- `Clippings/`, `Readwise/`: imported material and reading highlights.\n- `Excalidraw/`, `Markwhen/`: structured assets created by plugins.\n- Images and media live alongside notes (e.g., `Pasted image *.png`, `*.pdf`, `*.m4a`).\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nThere are no build or test commands for this vault. Open the vault in Obsidian and edit directly. Optional maintenance you might run locally:\n- `rg \"\" .` to search for terms across notes.\n- `ls templates` to review reusable templates before creating new notes.\n\n## Coding Style \u0026 Naming Conventions\n- Markdown-first: use `#`/`##` headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists.\n- File naming: prefer descriptive titles (`how to begin.md`) or date-based logs (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`). Keep existing casing and spacing.\n- Links: use Obsidian-style wikilinks when referencing other notes (e.g., `[[Welcome]]`).\n- Assets: keep images near related notes; name pasted images with timestamps if created by Obsidian.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\nNo automated tests. Validate content by opening in Obsidian and checking that links resolve and media renders.\n\n## Commit \u0026 Pull Request Guidelines\nThis vault is not tracked by Git in this directory, so there is no Git history to infer conventions from. If you add version control later, use concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., \"Add January 2026 log\") and include a brief PR description that lists affected note paths and any renamed files.\n\n====\n\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.572826225Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/AI-Infra-and-the-Compute-Gap":{"title":"AI Infra and the Compute Gap","content":"\n#thinkpiece\n\"Ironically (and thankfully!) in the 'age of AI' we have more skeptics than dreamers.

Weapons Policy\n\nNo weapons will be allowed at Quartz community events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.\n\n## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n\n## 7.

In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n\n## 8. Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify @jackyzha0 with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\n\n## 9. Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\n\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n\n## 10.

Wood is dense. And back when we still printed things on paper, a heavy stapler was a luxury.1\n  If something is heavy, we assume it matters. And often, it does. Weight signals quality, durability, presence, permanence.\n  Even the objects we choose reflect this. At first, we buy cheap, lightweight furniture—easy to build, easy to trash. But eventually, we want weight. A solid oak table. A leather armchair. Something built to last. Heavy things comfort us—a weighted blanket stills the body, a heavy door makes a home feel secure.\n  Winners of major awards almost always say the same thing as they lift the trophy: ‘Wow! It’s so heavy.’ As though the weight itself validates the achievement. Simple logic: Light achievements beget light awards. Heavy achievements beget heavy awards.\n  We accept this in the physical world.\n  But online, we forget.\n  The internet is (mostly) a machine for light things.\n  The modern makers’ machine does not want you to create heavy things. It runs on the internet—powered by social media, fueled by mass appeal, and addicted to speed. It thrives on spikes, scrolls, and screenshots. It resists weight and avoids friction. It does not care for patience, deliberation, or anything but production.\n  It doesn’t care what you create, only that you keep creating. Make more. Make faster. Make lighter. (Make slop if you have to.) Make something that can be consumed in a breath and discarded just as quickly. Heavy things take time. And here, time is a tax. And so, we oblige—everyone does.\n  We create more than ever, but it weighs nothing.\n  AI now promises results without the reckoning, but frictionless creation leads to weightless rewards. No one dreams of merely pushing a button to generate their magnum opus. The output matters, but the intention, the struggle, the care is what makes it count — what gives it weight.2\n  Of course, there’s a range from light to heavy, and not all light things are bad. An entire economy thrives on lightness. Memes, breaking news, and celebrity drama shape culture in spades. But movement isn’t meaning. A million views doesn’t make a pound of significance. Light things shape culture, but rarely shape us.\n  Creation isn’t just about output. It’s a process of becoming. The best work shapes the maker as much as the audience. A founder builds a startup to prove they can. A writer wrestles an idea into clarity. You don’t just create heavy things. You become someone who can.\n  Many light things don’t add up to one heavy thing.\n  So many creators start in the shallow pool of some algorithm’s grip—until, inevitably, they go searching for something heavier. From short-form to long-form. From building in public to locking in to solitude, obsession, deep work. To create a book, a film, an album, a company—something that stands alone.\n  No matter how many you stack, Tweets and TikToks don’t add up to something heavy. They don’t solidify. At best, they’re a pile of snowflakes, intricate yet ephemeral. Beautiful while they’re here, gone before they hit the ground.3\n  Substack, with its many virtues, finds itself at a crossroads — I’d put it in the midweight creation zone (if used well). Writers stack posts, building up a library of words that starts to feel substantial. It’s good that long-form posts can go viral faster and stick around longer. But it’s still not quite as heavy as writers’ loftiest dreams, at least not yet. Even the most successful Substackers, those who’ve turned newsletters into brands and businesses, start pondering their endgame.\n  They want to make one really, really good thing. One truly heavy thing. A book. A manifesto. A movie. A media company. A monument. — A masterpiece.4\n  Not just for the prestige or the money, but for the proverbial \"F-U\" to ephemerality. For the way it anchors them to something lasting while giving them the freedom to breathe. For the way it sticks in the hearts and minds of other people who encounter it too.\n  Heavy projects are the lifeblood of creative fulfillment — and creative longevity. And for now, no platform truly offers that kind of weight on its own. Platforms are built to amplify, not anchor.5\n  You’re either making in light mode or in heavy mode.\n  Light mode is fast and iterative, producing work that’s quick to make but just as quick to fade. It’s the mode of rapid experiments, side quests, and prolific posting. Heavy mode is slower, deliberate, and intentional (often hermit mode). It’s the mode of deep work that builds over time and carries lasting weight.\n  Some go straight for the heavy: building the billion-dollar startup, writing the world-changing book, recording the defining album. No pit stops. Or, in less relative terms: things that will stand on their own and stand the test of time. Weight is lindy.6 Others build up to the heavy things: essays before the book, short films before the feature, prototypes before the big product (maybe a few silly ‘GPT wrappers’ before the serious one). Lightness has its virtues — it helps keep you fresh, get in the reps, and work up to the heavy thing.\n  At any given time, you’re either pre–heavy thing or post–heavy thing. You’ve either made something weighty already, or you haven’t. Pre–heavy thing people are still searching, experimenting, iterating. Post–heavy thing people have crossed the threshold. They’ve made something of substance—something that commands respect, inspires others, and becomes a foundation to build on. And it shows. They move with confidence and calm. (But this feeling doesn’t always last forever.)7 Your gut knows what state you’re in. And the cycle repeats.\n  No one wants to stay in light mode forever. Sooner or later, everyone gravitates toward heavy mode—toward making something with weight. Your life’s work will be heavy. Finding the balance of light and heavy is the game.8\n  Note: heavy doesn’t have to mean “big.” Heavy can be small, niche, hard to scale. What I’m talking about is more like density. It’s about what is defining, meaningful, durable.\n  You feel like an imposter when you only make light things.\n  Everyone calls themselves a creator now. It’s the default title of the moment, the identity of an era. But does everyone who claims it actually feel it? Do they know the deep, anchored satisfaction of having made something that carries weight?\n  Telling everyone they’re a creator has only fostered a new strain of imposter syndrome. Being called a creator doesn’t make you one or make you feel like one; creating something with weight does. When you’ve made something heavy—something that stands on its own—you don’t need validation. You just know, because you feel its weight in your hands. And that weight is its own reward.\n  It’s not that most people can’t make heavy things. It’s that they don’t notice they aren’t. Lightness has its virtues—it pulls us in, subtly, innocently, whispering, 'Just do things.' The machine rewards movement, so we keep going, collecting badges. One day, we look up and realize we’ve been running in place.\n  And then you feel it: a quiet, gnawing hollowness that, for all the making, nothing has truly been made. Why does it feel bad to stop posting after weeks of consistency? Because the force of your work instantly drops to zero. It was all motion, no mass—momentum without weight. 99% dopamine, near-zero serotonin, and no trace of oxytocin. This is the contemporary creator’s dilemma—the contemporary generation’s dilemma.\n  You don’t feel like a true creator because you haven’t made anything heavy, and deep down, you know light things don’t count. Your output is high, but your imprint is low. You ship, but you do not build. You call yourself a creator, but what have you made that could survive a month offline? A year? A decade? If you stopped posting tomorrow, would anything remain? Creating for 24-hour cycles isn’t freedom, leverage, or legacy—it’s just renting out your time.\n  The weight of what we make matters.\n  Creative people are restless souls, forever chasing the horizon until they’ve made \n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.822828755Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/Regression-to-the-Mean":{"title":"Regression to the Mean","content":"\n\"for the rest of my life, a friend used to console me that cream always rises to the top.

Synthesizers: \"That’s not real music!\" - Became the defining sound of the 80s. Drum Machines: \"You’re putting drummers out of work!\" - Ended up creating entire genres. Sampling: \"That’s just stealing!\" - Now it’s an art form. DAWs: \"Real musicians use tape!\" - Now the absolute industry standard. VSTs: \"Plugins will kill real instruments!\" - Now orchestral film scores are made with them. Vocaloids: \"That’s not real singing!\" - Now featured in Grammy-nominated work.

Compression models are typically gan based or diffusion based. suno/udio have likely trained their own compression models as publicly available versions of these models are mono.\n\t\t- compression models take music and 'compress' them into discrete tokens that the language/music transformer model can handle, than decompress the generated tokens by the language/music transformer model back into normal music. text encoders take text and generate embeddings that the model uses to predict its 'music' tokens with.\n\t\t- during training, music is combined with text embeddings (usually a description, tags, bpm etc) and fed through the model.

Exacerbated by researchers often planning and staggering their jobs so when the first job doesn't run, the plan doesn't work out. One big contributing root cause of this is overallocation. We want to make sure that any GPU a researcher thinks they have is actually available and schedule-able.\n- This would require RPMs to essentially \"de-allocate\" some capacity to stop overallocation. This may feel bad to teams at the onset, but actually their daily experience scheduling will feel better and they'll be able to plan around actual capacity they have and avoid really frustrating experiences\n- Further, I think all of this is even worse because a lot of individual researchers don't know about overallocation. In a previous life when I was doing allocation, if there was overallocation it was widely announced the overallocation percentage so people understood that their jobs would need to queue before being scheduled. Now I feel we have an expectation that our jobs will schedule instantly while overallocation is also on and I think this misalignment in expectation just creates bad vibes.\n- For flex, one other thing that I know we all know about is fairness. One issue here is that people seem to squat compute endlessly. For example,  this week in alignment we found someone squatting from before the whitelists were rolled out. So I think we need to add a point about fairness in flex (and no squatting on other people's compute) in order for flex to be operational or a few people can soak up all the flex for everyone\n\n![:plus-pulse:](https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T03025Z7DT4/plus-pulse/cd9d88c3d34188b6.gif)3\n\n![](https://ca.slack-edge.com/E03025Z7DT4-U05BAEV0K7G-aa28cfb0c739-48)\n\nJos Kraaijeveld![:jos-kraaijeveld-helping-you-move-your-engine:](https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1\u0026o1=gu\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Femoji.slack-edge.com%2FT03025Z7DT4%2Fjos-kraaijeveld-helping-you-move-your-engine%2Fecef9c1fe5abb957.gif)  [Today at 10:39 AM](https://openai.slack.com/archives/C09PXLUK7QD/p1762540795311789?thread_ts=1762540062.151639\u0026cid=C09PXLUK7QD)  \n\n100% yeah the short-term world I want to try and promise to people is \"in quota your job will run as soon as you schedule it\" and \"on flex your job will run at some point (in reasonable time)\"\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.924829788Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/benefits-2025":{"title":"benefits 2025","content":"\nvision: Guardian VIS Premier 180 \n- either get 180$ of contacts, or 50$ copay for frames/lenses\n- dec 2025\nmedical: anthem blue cross HDHP\ndental: Guardian PPO Premier \n\n![[Screenshot 2025-12-24 at 10.50.39 AM.png]]\n1-800-877-7195","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.924829788Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/bfriday-shopping-list":{"title":"bfriday shopping list","content":"\n- oura ring https://ouraring.com/store/rings/oura-ring-4/silver\nskincare\n- cleanser https://www.amazon.com/COSRX-Good-Morning-Cleanser-150ml/dp/B016NRXO06/ref=sr_1_10?crid=3HUX8CC52CJD7\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1HeLrk59SG5SsfRV9sliFIfpCZBPafsBt_nvpCOl4pCjWjkjb1hy2WFakPc50gN02H-GQN8EixMApX8Ad6VmRvI5OZ_qC2HU42k-P8qiLiUmJA4T4ZizOkY_aMBtRqope0_N0_NTBtwglX419Q1NgdWqlXD2pSJrBYx8KTVJSksous9lDa12FJNjiDs5kk0fhHffxI9VFx6lB-GIBa-Yu-IU2syjZ6LR-ZJ-FmJUyiQ244vPFNcGPEpEntAPwKszU0aJokCeVLOMTZaDvfFlMvWxxZ2zl-r2sN9QPXLM8U4.k1tDZMRBjUoAgEuypC37lxGrkX67hAeSG-kUckbI94A\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=asian+facial+cleanser\u0026qid=1764253819\u0026sprefix=asian+facial+clenaser%2Caps%2C80\u0026sr=8-10\n- vitamin c \n\t- https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-vitamin-renovator-radiance/dp/B07PM79MSC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7M93A9EO4RL6\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Aabz5bLk7tsy2ezVq-1wmfDp5IuiCFkAKFd2UXXgq9KG_JtNx17D0_J0kAYjBU_Z4Q_k22wvRIuVYmhFSKDIwvYbRwz7rMZzlAXk8xN2boBenM1eg0SRCyGozciHHxlZbkcxwKc8MMJK9Co51zjCxeiT6w3bVuRbo3j3_UQGwPvGr-5MfcFAeHDM8mUsJGEamKcobd7-AasYqP9QLmBnP0RZCuWmJrJkTeRkhM_RhsPWusgNvZvk8QKna2vXi33ejF9zBocYTMyECuSkM1Vj_52KzhmdT9ni3t2HHFetsN0.qnQy0Ei2jxINlbGdNTDTY1Z64rqCfOgNg_xcHnxE7UI\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=la+roche+posay+vitamin+c10\u0026qid=1764253850\u0026sprefix=la+roche+posay+vitamin+c10%2Caps%2C97\u0026sr=8-1\n- gua sha \n\t- https://www.amazon.com/BAIMEI-Roller-Massager-Treatment-Routine/dp/B08RD6S5HF/ref=sr_1_7?crid=974Z98OH5MZ7\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LadGt9S5g8PqpZhFVVXlRirKVIiEj05OCtnBGeypY2nHwJiE0plGaEf7TF6wtnWHAcrId71X8tygCpc1Zk058TK79r18ON6Z-967rm7G168Dhnw7uYv0iL2rbn_2QUcX8-RCFyv8ZE8El8nv-w1l12QvSlsOhjKVD9fR-i-mU10nrYNNG2YjxZ--Bo_1kYtvgbu_F7hFzQTRWZnEfA6ceCNVoyo1qbXOwO9hWQyQzZDNElKyP24M5u7cZpCRj_35d5Xn4Q5AA1iPLn_D9VOQbSwOb_psvK5h6hOLo4PimyQ.ALsM9wmT2CSqMXX4I2biChuKt4Pmz2LXvvJLbbVujPk\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=gua+sha\u0026qid=1764253898\u0026sprefix=gua+sha%2Caps%2C83\u0026sr=8-7 \n\njacket\n\nshoes\n[- sam edelman boots](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/sam-edelman-womens-perin-round-toe-boots?ID=23837192\u0026pla_country=US\u0026CAGPSPN=pla\u0026trackingid=\u0026m_sc=sem\u0026m_sb=Google\u0026m_tp=PLA\u0026m_ac=Google_Womens_Shoes_PLA\u0026m_ag=\u0026m_cn=GGL_Women%27s_Shoes_PMax_PLA\u0026m_pi=go_cmp-20829431173_adg-_ad-__dev-c_ext-_prd-199037584635USA\u0026gad_source=1\u0026gad_campaignid=20819204613\u0026gbraid=0AAAAABdhj5800UMrXGfVowwozueCMP5nN\u0026gclid=CjwKCAiA55rJBhByEiwAFkY1QGxNEV1rIqWO-Y1CITePhm8tTXL40zg6QV5ZdXdFlnBGd2pWlkuxmxoCXysQAvD_BwE)\n\nhttps://www.thereformation.com/products/monica-silk-top/1314146BLK.html?\u0026dwvar_1314146BLK_color=LPS\u0026dwvar_1314146BLK_size=00S\u0026quantity=1 \n\nhttps://www.thereformation.com/products/elio-knit-top/1314353BLK.html?\u0026dwvar_1314353BLK_color=FDL\u0026quantity=1","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.924829788Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/bicoastal":{"title":"bicoastal","content":"\nSure — here is the **entire article rewritten in plain, simple, clear text**, without the ads, headers, or formatting noise. It reads smoothly but keeps all the original meaning.\n\n---\n\n### **Bicoastal living isn’t just for the ultra-wealthy. Here’s how younger creatives make it work.**\n\n_Rewritten in plain text_\n\nAri Takata-Vasquez sometimes wakes up unsure which city she’s in. One morning in May, she thought she heard an Oakland police officer making an announcement outside her downtown apartment. But she wasn’t in Oakland at all — she was in her Brooklyn place, listening to a school loudspeaker across the street. This kind of time-zone confusion is one of the quirks of living bicoastally.\n\nTakata-Vasquez is one of a growing number of younger people who split their time between California and New York. Many of them aren’t wealthy; they’re freelance artists or small-business owners. They travel constantly to maintain ties to communities, customers, and creative opportunities in both places.\n\nHyungi Park, a tattoo and incense artist, travels between Los Angeles and New York every three weeks. She’s been doing this for over a year and says that despite the travel, it’s worth it and still feels like a dream.\n\nMore people have been living far away from their workplaces since the pandemic. Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford professor who studies remote work, says that number has more than doubled. But this trend is different from remote tech workers relocating. These creatives feel professionally and personally anchored to both coasts — and more people are following their lead.\n\nFor example, Oakland jeweler Chelsea Calalay, 30, hopes to sublet a place in New York next year. She says she needs to go where her customers are.\n\nStill, living bi-coastally is not easy. California and New York are about 2,500 miles apart, both have extremely expensive housing markets, and flights often cost hundreds of dollars. Park, who grew up in Texas and North Carolina, found a system that works: she pays for housing only in Los Angeles, where she also has a storefront, and her partner pays for their Brooklyn apartment.\n\nTakata-Vasquez, 34, a muralist and designer who grew up in Hawaii, splits her year seasonally: spring and fall in Brooklyn, summer and winter in Oakland. She sublets whichever apartment she’s not living in, and says there’s always demand for rentals in those markets.\n\nHome-swapping has also made bicoastal life easier. Kindred, a home-exchange platform, has grown sevenfold in the past year and now has 150,000 members. Founder Justine Palefsky says New York is their most popular city, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles, and the most requested swap is between L.A. and New York.\n\nElectronic musician and composer Amma Ateria, 42, lives between San Francisco, Albany (California), and Brooklyn by staying with family and friends. She says the lifestyle is challenging and exhausting — she hates packing so much that it sometimes makes her cry — but she’s trying to manage it with grace.\n\nDespite the fatigue, all three artists are committed to both coasts. They rely on each place for different reasons. Ateria says the Bay Area is where she rests, focuses, and works quietly on her music, while New York is where she performs, pushes herself creatively, and finds the venues that support her career.\n\nTakata-Vasquez feels deeply connected to both the Black Puerto Rican side of her family in New York and the Oakland community she’s been part of for 17 years.\n\nPark says bicoastal life is less glamorous than people assume but also more doable, thanks to apartment swaps and airline mileage deals. By May, she had already taken 12 flights between L.A. and New York this year, often working on her laptop during the flights.\n\nWhen people ask her to choose between L.A. and New York, she says she can’t — the two cities balance each other.

your mother entering the hospital in a bright yellow jacket, both swollen and hopeful, ready to shed winter's weight.\n\n\"What they don't understand about birthdays and what they never tell you is that when you're eleven, you're also ten, and nine, and eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four, and three, and two and one.\" the years stack like geological layers, each birthday a new sediment of experience. sometimes when people ask my age i've said 22 with a sheepish grin - simultaneously wanting to be older and ageless. age-agnostic, perhaps, because i feel just as angsty and confused and unsettled as i did at eleven, and probably will at thirty.\n\ni waste my youth in a terrible hurry to read all the books, see all the movies, listen to all the music - always satiated but always slightly hungry. *to be young is to be constantly on the precipice of perfection*, but the years slowly eat away at your margin for error until there is no margin left. mistakes transform from flaws of inexperience into flaws of character.\n\nyet in this rush of becoming, i am delighted by humans above all. generosity of time is a quality you cannot optimize: the core of friendship is a mutual buy-in, an inherent social contract to invest in each other's stories. it's michelle making cookie batter the night before, shirling waking early to bake a flower-adorned cake, justin quietly clearing plates, gary capturing moments with his heavy-weight sony. four cameras of different fidelities preserving a single moment of joy.\n\nwhen i look at emptiness all the coins inside me start rattling, restless. meaning-making functions as a daily wrestle with light - in moments of blinding brightness, you have no idea what shape your shadows will take. but around me, friends ground these moments in reality. their generosity of time reminds me that we're all just trying to make sense of our shadows together, watching winter melt into spring, year after year.\n\nperhaps that is what growing up is: learning to find comfort in this cycle of seasons, in the way we carry all our past selves forward, in how we learn to give our time to others. the light is most golden just before the shadows fall, but even in darkness, we are never truly alone.\n\n[[hunger and comfort]]\n[[the light is most golden just before the shadows fall]]","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:16.925829798Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/container":{"title":"container","content":"\ntiny, self-contained package that bundles _your program + everything it needs to run (libraries, runtime)_ and gives that package a lightweight sandbox on a machine.\ne.g. it's **shipping container for software**: everything your app needs goes inside one box so that the app behaves the same whether it’s on your laptop, CI, or a 1,000-node GPU cluster.\n\nthis results in easy reproducibility -

Parsing the command-line arguments using [yargs](http://yargs.js.org/).\n   2. Transpiling and bundling the rest of Quartz (which is in Typescript) to regular JavaScript using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). The `esbuild` configuration here is slightly special as it also handles `.scss` file imports using [esbuild-sass-plugin v2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-sass-plugin). Additionally, we bundle 'inline' client-side scripts (any `.inline.ts` file) that components declare using a custom `esbuild` plugin that runs another instance of `esbuild` which bundles for the browser instead of `node`. Modules of both types are imported as plain text.\n   3. Running the local preview server if `--serve` is set. This starts two servers:\n      1. A WebSocket server on port 3001 to handle hot-reload signals. This tracks all inbound connections and sends a 'rebuild' message a server-side change is detected (either content or configuration).\n      2. An HTTP file-server on a user defined port (normally 8080) to serve the actual website files.\n   4. If the `--serve` flag is set, it also starts a file watcher to detect source-code changes (e.g. anything that is `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.scss`, or packager files). On a change, we rebuild the module (step 2 above) using esbuild's [rebuild API](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#rebuild) which drastically reduces the build times.\n   5. After transpiling the main Quartz build module (`quartz/build.ts`), we write it to a cache file `.quartz-cache/transpiled-build.mjs` and then dynamically import this using `await import(cacheFile)`. However, we need to be pretty smart about how to bust Node's [import cache](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/307) so we add a random query string to fake Node into thinking it's a new module. This does, however, cause memory leaks so we just hope that the user doesn't hot-reload their configuration too many times in a single session :)) (it leaks about ~350kB memory on each reload). After importing the module, we then invoke it, passing in the command line arguments we parsed earlier along with a callback function to signal the client to refresh.\n4. In `build.ts`, we start by installing source map support manually to account for the query string cache busting hack we introduced earlier. Then, we start processing content:\n   1. Clean the output directory.\n   2. Recursively glob all files in the `content` folder, respecting the `.gitignore`.\n   3. Parse the Markdown files.\n      1. Quartz detects the number of threads available and chooses to spawn worker threads if there are \u003e128 pieces of content to parse (rough heuristic). If it needs to spawn workers, it will invoke esbuild again to transpile the worker script `quartz/worker.ts`. Then, a work-stealing [workerpool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workerpool) is then created and batches of 128 files are assigned to workers.\n      2. Each worker (or just the main thread if there is no concurrency) creates a [unified](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) parser based off of the plugins defined in the [[configuration]].\n      3. Parsing has three steps:\n         1. Read the file into a [vfile](https://github.com/vfile/vfile).\n         2. Applied plugin-defined text transformations over the content.\n         3. Slugify the file path and store it in the data for the file. See the page on [[paths]] for more details about how path logic works in Quartz (spoiler: its complicated).\n         4. Markdown parsing using [remark-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-parse) (text to [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast)).\n         5. Apply plugin-defined Markdown-to-Markdown transformations.\n         6. Convert Markdown into HTML using [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype) ([mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) to [hast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast)).\n         7. Apply plugin-defined HTML-to-HTML transformations.\n   4. Filter out unwanted content using plugins.\n   5. Emit files using plugins.\n      1. Gather all the static resources (e.g. external CSS, JS modules, etc.) each emitter plugin declares.\n      2. Emitters that emit HTML files do a bit of extra work here as they need to transform the [hast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) produced in the parse step to JSX. This is done using [hast-util-to-jsx-runtime](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-jsx-runtime) with the [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) runtime. Finally, the JSX is rendered to HTML using [preact-render-to-string](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-render-to-string) which statically renders the JSX to HTML (i.e. doesn't care about `useState`, `useEffect`, or any other React/Preact interactive bits). Here, we also do a bunch of fun stuff like assemble the page [[layout]] from `quartz.layout.ts`, assemble all the inline scripts that actually get shipped to the client, and all the transpiled styles. The bulk of this logic can be found in `quartz/components/renderPage.tsx`. Other fun things of note:\n         1. CSS is minified and transformed using [Lightning CSS](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss) to add vendor prefixes and do syntax lowering.\n         2. Scripts are split into `beforeDOMLoaded` and `afterDOMLoaded` and are inserted in the `\u003chead\u003e` and `\u003cbody\u003e` respectively.\n      3. Finally, each emitter plugin is responsible for emitting and writing it's own emitted files to disk.\n   6. If the `--serve` flag was detected, we also set up another file watcher to detect content changes (only `.md` files). We keep a content map that tracks the parsed AST and plugin data for each slug and update this on file changes. Newly added or modified paths are rebuilt and added to the content map. Then, all the filters and emitters are run over the resulting content map. This file watcher is debounced with a threshold of 250ms. On success, we send a client refresh signal using the passed in callback function.\n\n## On the client\n\n1. The browser opens a Quartz page and loads the HTML. The `\u003chead\u003e` also links to page styles (emitted to `public/index.css`) and page-critical JS (emitted to `public/prescript.js`)\n2. Then, once the body is loaded, the browser loads the non-critical JS (emitted to `public/postscript.js`)\n3. Once the page is done loading, the page will then dispatch a custom synthetic browser event `\"nav\"`. This is used so client-side scripts declared by components can 'setup' anything that requires access to the page DOM.\n   1. If the [[SPA Routing|enableSPA option]] is enabled in the [[configuration]], this `\"nav\"` event is also fired on any client-navigation to allow for components to unregister and reregister any event handlers and state.\n   2. If it's not, we wire up the `\"nav\"` event to just be fired a single time after page load to allow for consistency across how state is setup across both SPA and non-SPA contexts.\n\nThe architecture and design of the plugin system was intentionally left pretty vague here as this is described in much more depth in the guide on [[making plugins|making your own plugin]].\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.079831356Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/docs/advanced/creating-components":{"title":"Creating your own Quartz components","content":"\n\u003e [!warning]\n\u003e This guide assumes you have experience writing JavaScript and are familiar with TypeScript.\n\nNormally on the web, we write layout code using HTML which looks something like the following:\n\n```html\n\u003carticle\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eAn article header\u003c/h1\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eSome content\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/article\u003e\n```\n\nThis piece of HTML represents an article with a leading header that says \"An article header\" and a paragraph that contains the text \"Some content\". This is combined with CSS to style the page and JavaScript to add interactivity.\n\nHowever, HTML doesn't let you create reusable templates. If you wanted to create a new page, you would need to copy and paste the above snippet and edit the header and content yourself. This isn't great if we have a lot of content on our site that shares a lot of similar layout. The smart people who created React also had similar complaints and invented the concept of Components -- JavaScript functions that return JSX -- to solve the code duplication problem.\n\nIn effect, components allow you to write a JavaScript function that takes some data and produces HTML as an output. **While Quartz doesn't use React, it uses the same component concept to allow you to easily express layout templates in your Quartz site.**\n\n## An Example Component\n\n### Constructor\n\nComponent files are written in `.tsx` files that live in the `quartz/components` folder. These are re-exported in `quartz/components/index.ts` so you can use them in layouts and other components more easily.\n\nEach component file should have a default export that satisfies the `QuartzComponentConstructor` function signature. It's a function that takes in a single optional parameter `opts` and returns a Quartz Component. The type of the parameters `opts` is defined by the interface `Options` which you as the component creator also decide.\n\nIn your component, you can use the values from the configuration option to change the rendering behaviour inside of your component. For example, the component in the code snippet below will not render if the `favouriteNumber` option is below 0.\n\n```tsx {11-17}\ninterface Options {\n  favouriteNumber: number\n}\n\nconst defaultOptions: Options = {\n  favouriteNumber: 42,\n}\n\nexport default ((userOpts?: Options) =\u003e {\n  const opts = { ...userOpts, ...defaultOpts }\n  function YourComponent(props: QuartzComponentProps) {\n    if (opts.favouriteNumber \u003c 0) {\n      return null\n    }\n\n    return \u003cp\u003eMy favourite number is {opts.favouriteNumber}\u003c/p\u003e\n  }\n\n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n```\n\n### Props\n\nThe Quartz component itself (lines 11-17 highlighted above) looks like a React component. It takes in properties (sometimes called [props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)) and returns JSX.\n\nAll Quartz components accept the same set of props:\n\n```tsx title=\"quartz/components/types.ts\"\n// simplified for sake of demonstration\nexport type QuartzComponentProps = {\n  fileData: QuartzPluginData\n  cfg: GlobalConfiguration\n  tree: Node\u003cQuartzPluginData\u003e\n  allFiles: QuartzPluginData[]\n  displayClass?: \"mobile-only\" | \"desktop-only\"\n}\n```\n\n- `fileData`: Any metadata [[making plugins|plugins]] may have added to the current page.\n  - `fileData.slug`: slug of the current page.\n  - `fileData.frontmatter`: any frontmatter parsed.\n- `cfg`: The `configuration` field in `quartz.config.ts`.\n- `tree`: the resulting [HTML AST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) after processing and transforming the file. This is useful if you'd like to render the content using [hast-util-to-jsx-runtime](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-jsx-runtime) (you can find an example of this in `quartz/components/pages/Content.tsx`).\n- `allFiles`: Metadata for all files that have been parsed. Useful for doing page listings or figuring out the overall site structure.\n- `displayClass`: a utility class that indicates a preference from the user about how to render it in a mobile or desktop setting. Helpful if you want to conditionally hide a component on mobile or desktop.\n\n### Styling\n\nQuartz components can also define a `.css` property on the actual function component which will get picked up by Quartz. This is expected to be a CSS string which can either be inlined or imported from a `.scss` file.\n\nNote that inlined styles **must** be plain vanilla CSS:\n\n```tsx {6-10} title=\"quartz/components/YourComponent.tsx\"\nexport default (() =\u003e {\n  function YourComponent() {\n    return \u003cp class=\"red-text\"\u003eExample Component\u003c/p\u003e\n  }\n\n  YourComponent.css = `\n  p.red-text {\n    color: red;\n  }\n  `\n\n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n```\n\nImported styles, however, can be from SCSS files:\n\n```tsx {1-2,9} title=\"quartz/components/YourComponent.tsx\"\n// assuming your stylesheet is in quartz/components/styles/YourComponent.scss\nimport styles from \"./styles/YourComponent.scss\"\n\nexport default (() =\u003e {\n  function YourComponent() {\n    return \u003cp\u003eExample Component\u003c/p\u003e\n  }\n\n  YourComponent.css = styles\n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n```\n\n\u003e [!warning]\n\u003e Quartz does not use CSS modules so any styles you declare here apply _globally_. If you only want it to apply to your component, make sure you use specific class names and selectors.\n\n### Scripts and Interactivity\n\nWhat about interactivity? Suppose you want to add an-click handler for example. Like the `.css` property on the component, you can also declare `.beforeDOMLoaded` and `.afterDOMLoaded` properties that are strings that contain the script.\n\n```tsx title=\"quartz/components/YourComponent.tsx\"\nexport default (() =\u003e {\n  function YourComponent() {\n    return \u003cbutton id=\"btn\"\u003eClick me\u003c/button\u003e\n  }\n\n  YourComponent.beforeDOMLoaded = `\n  console.log(\"hello from before the page loads!\")\n  `\n\n  YourComponent.afterDOMLoaded = `\n  document.getElementById('btn').onclick = () =\u003e {\n    alert('button clicked!')\n  }\n  `\n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n```\n\n\u003e [!hint]\n\u003e For those coming from React, Quartz components are different from React components in that it only uses JSX for templating and layout. Hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`, etc. are not rendered and other properties that accept functions like `onClick` handlers will not work. Instead, do it using a regular JS script that modifies the DOM element directly.\n\nAs the names suggest, the `.beforeDOMLoaded` scripts are executed _before_ the page is done loading so it doesn't have access to any elements on the page. This is mostly used to prefetch any critical data.\n\nThe `.afterDOMLoaded` script executes once the page has been completely loaded. This is a good place to setup anything that should last for the duration of a site visit (e.g. getting something saved from local storage).\n\nIf you need to create an `afterDOMLoaded` script that depends on _page specific_ elements that may change when navigating to a new page, you can listen for the `\"nav\"` event that gets fired whenever a page loads (which may happen on navigation if [[SPA Routing]] is enabled).\n\n```ts\ndocument.addEventListener(\"nav\", () =\u003e {\n  // do page specific logic here\n  // e.g. attach event listeners\n  const toggleSwitch = document.querySelector(\"#switch\") as HTMLInputElement\n  toggleSwitch.addEventListener(\"change\", switchTheme)\n  window.addCleanup(() =\u003e toggleSwitch.removeEventListener(\"change\", switchTheme))\n})\n```\n\nIt is best practice to track any event handlers via `window.addCleanup` to prevent memory leaks.\nThis will get called on page navigation.\n\n#### Importing Code\n\nOf course, it isn't always practical (nor desired!) to write your code as a string literal in the component.\n\nQuartz supports importing component code through `.inline.ts` files.\n\n```tsx title=\"quartz/components/YourComponent.tsx\"\n// @ts-ignore: typescript doesn't know about our inline bundling system\n// so we need to silence the error\nimport script from \"./scripts/graph.inline\"\n\nexport default (() =\u003e {\n  function YourComponent() {\n    return \u003cbutton id=\"btn\"\u003eClick me\u003c/button\u003e\n  }\n\n  YourComponent.afterDOMLoaded = script\n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n```\n\n```ts title=\"quartz/components/scripts/graph.inline.ts\"\n// any imports here are bundled for the browser\nimport * as d3 from \"d3\"\n\ndocument.getElementById(\"btn\").onclick = () =\u003e {\n  alert(\"button clicked!\")\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, like what is shown in the example above, you can import packages in `.inline.ts` files. This will be bundled by Quartz and included in the actual script.\n\n### Using a Component\n\nAfter creating your custom component, re-export it in `quartz/components/index.ts`:\n\n```ts title=\"quartz/components/index.ts\" {4,10}\nimport ArticleTitle from \"./ArticleTitle\"\nimport Content from \"./pages/Content\"\nimport Darkmode from \"./Darkmode\"\nimport YourComponent from \"./YourComponent\"\n\nexport { ArticleTitle, Content, Darkmode, YourComponent }\n```\n\nThen, you can use it like any other component in `quartz.layout.ts` via `Component.YourComponent()`. See the [[configuration#Layout|layout]] section for more details.\n\nAs Quartz components are just functions that return React components, you can compositionally use them in other Quartz components.\n\n```tsx title=\"quartz/components/AnotherComponent.tsx\"\nimport YourComponent from \"./YourComponent\"\n\nexport default (() =\u003e {\n  function AnotherComponent(props: QuartzComponentProps) {\n    return (\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eIt's nested!\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cYourComponent {...props} /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    )\n  }\n\n  return AnotherComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n```\n\n\u003e [!hint]\n\u003e Look in `quartz/components` for more examples of components in Quartz as reference for your own components!\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.079831356Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/docs/advanced/making-plugins":{"title":"Making your own plugins","content":"\n\u003e [!warning]\n\u003e This part of the documentation will assume you have working knowledge in TypeScript and will include code snippets that describe the interface of what Quartz plugins should look like.\n\nQuartz's plugins are a series of transformations over content. This is illustrated in the diagram of the processing pipeline below:\n\n![[quartz transform pipeline.png]]\n\nAll plugins are defined as a function that takes in a single parameter for options `type OptionType = object | undefined` and return an object that corresponds to the type of plugin it is.\n\n```ts\ntype OptionType = object | undefined\ntype QuartzPlugin\u003cOptions extends OptionType = undefined\u003e = (opts?: Options) =\u003e QuartzPluginInstance\ntype QuartzPluginInstance =\n  | QuartzTransformerPluginInstance\n  | QuartzFilterPluginInstance\n  | QuartzEmitterPluginInstance\n```\n\nThe following sections will go into detail for what methods can be implemented for each plugin type. Before we do that, let's clarify a few more ambiguous types:\n\n- `BuildCtx` is defined in `quartz/ctx.ts`. It consists of\n  - `argv`: The command line arguments passed to the Quartz [[build]] command\n  - `cfg`: The full Quartz [[configuration]]\n  - `allSlugs`: a list of all the valid content slugs (see [[paths]] for more information on what a `ServerSlug` is)\n- `StaticResources` is defined in `quartz/resources.tsx`. It consists of\n  - `css`: a list of URLs for stylesheets that should be loaded\n  - `js`: a list of scripts that should be loaded. A script is described with the `JSResource` type which is also defined in `quartz/resources.tsx`. It allows you to define a load time (either before or after the DOM has been loaded), whether it should be a module, and either the source URL or the inline content of the script.\n\n## Transformers\n\nTransformers **map** over content, taking a Markdown file and outputting modified content or adding metadata to the file itself.\n\n```ts\nexport type QuartzTransformerPluginInstance = {\n  name: string\n  textTransform?: (ctx: BuildCtx, src: string | Buffer) =\u003e string | Buffer\n  markdownPlugins?: (ctx: BuildCtx) =\u003e PluggableList\n  htmlPlugins?: (ctx: BuildCtx) =\u003e PluggableList\n  externalResources?: (ctx: BuildCtx) =\u003e Partial\u003cStaticResources\u003e\n}\n```\n\nAll transformer plugins must define at least a `name` field to register the plugin and a few optional functions that allow you to hook into various parts of transforming a single Markdown file.\n\n- `textTransform` performs a text-to-text transformation _before_ a file is parsed into the [Markdown AST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast).\n- `markdownPlugins` defines a list of [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md). `remark` is a tool that transforms Markdown to Markdown in a structured way.\n- `htmlPlugins` defines a list of [rehype plugins](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md). Similar to how `remark` works, `rehype` is a tool that transforms HTML to HTML in a structured way.\n- `externalResources` defines any external resources the plugin may need to load on the client-side for it to work properly.\n\nNormally for both `remark` and `rehype`, you can find existing plugins that you can use to . If you'd like to create your own `remark` or `rehype` plugin, checkout the [guide to creating a plugin](https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/create-a-plugin/) using `unified` (the underlying AST parser and transformer library).\n\nA good example of a transformer plugin that borrows from the `remark` and `rehype` ecosystems is the [[plugins/Latex|Latex]] plugin:\n\n```ts title=\"quartz/plugins/transformers/latex.ts\"\nimport remarkMath from \"remark-math\"\nimport rehypeKatex from \"rehype-katex\"\nimport rehypeMathjax from \"rehype-mathjax/svg\"\nimport { QuartzTransformerPlugin } from \"../types\"\n\ninterface Options {\n  renderEngine: \"katex\" | \"mathjax\"\n}\n\nexport const Latex: QuartzTransformerPlugin\u003cOptions\u003e = (opts?: Options) =\u003e {\n  const engine = opts?.renderEngine ?? \"katex\"\n  return {\n    name: \"Latex\",\n    markdownPlugins() {\n      return [remarkMath]\n    },\n    htmlPlugins() {\n      if (engine === \"katex\") {\n        // if you need to pass options into a plugin, you\n        // can use a tuple of [plugin, options]\n        return [[rehypeKatex, { output: \"html\" }]]\n      } else {\n        return [rehypeMathjax]\n      }\n    },\n    externalResources() {\n      if (engine === \"katex\") {\n        return {\n          css: [\n            // base css\n            \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/katex.min.css\",\n          ],\n          js: [\n            {\n              // fix copy behaviour: https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/blob/main/contrib/copy-tex/README.md\n              src: \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/contrib/copy-tex.min.js\",\n              loadTime: \"afterDOMReady\",\n              contentType: \"external\",\n            },\n          ],\n        }\n      } else {\n        return {}\n      }\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnother common thing that transformer plugins will do is parse a file and add extra data for that file:\n\n```ts\nexport const AddWordCount: QuartzTransformerPlugin = () =\u003e {\n  return {\n    name: \"AddWordCount\",\n    markdownPlugins() {\n      return [\n        () =\u003e {\n          return (tree, file) =\u003e {\n            // tree is an `mdast` root element\n            // file is a `vfile`\n            const text = file.value\n            const words = text.split(\" \").length\n            file.data.wordcount = words\n          }\n        },\n      ]\n    },\n  }\n}\n\n// tell typescript about our custom data fields we are adding\n// other plugins will then also be aware of this data field\ndeclare module \"vfile\" {\n  interface DataMap {\n    wordcount: number\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, you can also perform transformations over Markdown or HTML ASTs using the `visit` function from the `unist-util-visit` package or the `findAndReplace` function from the `mdast-util-find-and-replace` package.\n\n```ts\nexport const TextTransforms: QuartzTransformerPlugin = () =\u003e {\n  return {\n    name: \"TextTransforms\",\n    markdownPlugins() {\n      return [() =\u003e {\n        return (tree, file) =\u003e {\n          // replace _text_ with the italics version\n          findAndReplace(tree, /_(.+)_/, (_value: string, ...capture: string[]) =\u003e {\n            // inner is the text inside of the () of the regex\n            const [inner] = capture\n            // return an mdast node\n            // https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast\n            return {\n              type: \"emphasis\",\n              children: [{ type: 'text', value: inner }]\n            }\n          })\n\n         // remove all links (replace with just the link content)\n         // match by 'type' field on an mdast node\n         // https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#link in this example\n          visit(tree, \"link\", (link: Link) =\u003e {\n            return {\n              type: \"paragraph\"\n              children: [{ type: 'text', value: link.title }]\n            }\n          })\n        }\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAll transformer plugins can be found under `quartz/plugins/transformers`. If you decide to write your own transformer plugin, don't forget to re-export it under `quartz/plugins/transformers/index.ts`\n\nA parting word: transformer plugins are quite complex so don't worry if you don't get them right away. Take a look at the built in transformers and see how they operate over content to get a better sense for how to accomplish what you are trying to do.\n\n## Filters\n\nFilters **filter** content, taking the output of all the transformers and determining what files to actually keep and what to discard.\n\n```ts\nexport type QuartzFilterPlugin\u003cOptions extends OptionType = undefined\u003e = (\n  opts?: Options,\n) =\u003e QuartzFilterPluginInstance\n\nexport type QuartzFilterPluginInstance = {\n  name: string\n  shouldPublish(ctx: BuildCtx, content: ProcessedContent): boolean\n}\n```\n\nA filter plugin must define a `name` field and a `shouldPublish` function that takes in a piece of content that has been processed by all the transformers and returns a `true` or `false` depending on whether it should be passed to the emitter plugins or not.\n\nFor example, here is the built-in plugin for removing drafts:\n\n```ts title=\"quartz/plugins/filters/draft.ts\"\nimport { QuartzFilterPlugin } from \"../types\"\n\nexport const RemoveDrafts: QuartzFilterPlugin\u003c{}\u003e = () =\u003e ({\n  name: \"RemoveDrafts\",\n  shouldPublish(_ctx, [_tree, vfile]) {\n    // uses frontmatter parsed from transformers\n    const draftFlag: boolean = vfile.data?.frontmatter?.draft ?? false\n    return !draftFlag\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Emitters\n\nEmitters **reduce** over content, taking in a list of all the transformed and filtered content and creating output files.\n\n```ts\nexport type QuartzEmitterPlugin\u003cOptions extends OptionType = undefined\u003e = (\n  opts?: Options,\n) =\u003e QuartzEmitterPluginInstance\n\nexport type QuartzEmitterPluginInstance = {\n  name: string\n  emit(ctx: BuildCtx, content: ProcessedContent[], resources: StaticResources): Promise\u003cFilePath[]\u003e\n  getQuartzComponents(ctx: BuildCtx): QuartzComponent[]\n}\n```\n\nAn emitter plugin must define a `name` field, an `emit` function, and a `getQuartzComponents` function. `emit` is responsible for looking at all the parsed and filtered content and then appropriately creating files and returning a list of paths to files the plugin created.\n\nCreating new files can be done via regular Node [fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) (i.e. `fs.cp` or `fs.writeFile`) or via the `write` function in `quartz/plugins/emitters/helpers.ts` if you are creating files that contain text. `write` has the following signature:\n\n```ts\nexport type WriteOptions = (data: {\n  // the build context\n  ctx: BuildCtx\n  // the name of the file to emit (not including the file extension)\n  slug: ServerSlug\n  // the file extension\n  ext: `.${string}` | \"\"\n  // the file content to add\n  content: string\n}) =\u003e Promise\u003cFilePath\u003e\n```\n\nThis is a thin wrapper around writing to the appropriate output folder and ensuring that intermediate directories exist. If you choose to use the native Node `fs` APIs, ensure you emit to the `argv.output` folder as well.\n\nIf you are creating an emitter plugin that needs to render components, there are three more things to be aware of:\n\n- Your component should use `getQuartzComponents` to declare a list of `QuartzComponents` that it uses to construct the page. See the page on [[creating components]] for more information.\n- You can use the `renderPage` function defined in `quartz/components/renderPage.tsx` to render Quartz components into HTML.\n- If you need to render an HTML AST to JSX, you can use the `htmlToJsx` function from `quartz/util/jsx.ts`. An example of this can be found in `quartz/components/pages/Content.tsx`.\n\nFor example, the following is a simplified version of the content page plugin that renders every single page.\n\n```tsx title=\"quartz/plugins/emitters/contentPage.tsx\"\nexport const ContentPage: QuartzEmitterPlugin = () =\u003e {\n  // construct the layout\n  const layout: FullPageLayout = {\n    ...sharedPageComponents,\n    ...defaultContentPageLayout,\n    pageBody: Content(),\n  }\n  const { head, header, beforeBody, pageBody, afterBody, left, right, footer } = layout\n  return {\n    name: \"ContentPage\",\n    getQuartzComponents() {\n      return [head, ...header, ...beforeBody, pageBody, ...afterBody, ...left, ...right, footer]\n    },\n    async emit(ctx, content, resources, emit): Promise\u003cFilePath[]\u003e {\n      const cfg = ctx.cfg.configuration\n      const fps: FilePath[] = []\n      const allFiles = content.map((c) =\u003e c[1].data)\n      for (const [tree, file] of content) {\n        const slug = canonicalizeServer(file.data.slug!)\n        const externalResources = pageResources(slug, resources)\n        const componentData: QuartzComponentProps = {\n          fileData: file.data,\n          externalResources,\n          cfg,\n          children: [],\n          tree,\n          allFiles,\n        }\n\n        const content = renderPage(cfg, slug, componentData, opts, externalResources)\n        const fp = await emit({\n          content,\n          slug: file.data.slug!,\n          ext: \".html\",\n        })\n\n        fps.push(fp)\n      }\n      return fps\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that it takes in a `FullPageLayout` as the options. It's made by combining a `SharedLayout` and a `PageLayout` both of which are provided through the `quartz.layout.ts` file.\n\n\u003e [!hint]\n\u003e Look in `quartz/plugins` for more examples of plugins in Quartz as reference for your own plugins!\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.079831356Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/docs/advanced/paths":{"title":"Paths in Quartz","content":"\nPaths are pretty complex to reason about because, especially for a static site generator, they can come from so many places.\n\nA full file path to a piece of content? Also a path. What about a slug for a piece of content? Yet another path.\n\nIt would be silly to type these all as `string` and call it a day as it's pretty common to accidentally mistake one type of path for another. Unfortunately, TypeScript does not have [nominal types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system) for type aliases meaning even if you made custom types of a server-side slug or a client-slug slug, you can still accidentally assign one to another and TypeScript wouldn't catch it.\n\nLuckily, we can mimic nominal typing using [brands](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/nominal-typing).\n\n```typescript\n// instead of\ntype FullSlug = string\n\n// we do\ntype FullSlug = string \u0026 { __brand: \"full\" }\n\n// that way, the following will fail typechecking\nconst slug: FullSlug = \"some random string\"\n```\n\nWhile this prevents most typing mistakes _within_ our nominal typing system (e.g. mistaking a server slug for a client slug), it doesn't prevent us from _accidentally_ mistaking a string for a client slug when we forcibly cast it.\n\nThus, we still need to be careful when casting from a string to one of these nominal types in the 'entrypoints', illustrated with hexagon shapes in the diagram below.\n\nThe following diagram draws the relationships between all the path sources, nominal path types, and what functions in `quartz/path.ts` convert between them.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    Browser{{Browser}} --\u003e Window{{Body}} \u0026 LinkElement{{Link Element}}\n    Window --\"getFullSlug()\"--\u003e FullSlug[Full Slug]\n    LinkElement --\".href\"--\u003e Relative[Relative URL]\n    FullSlug --\"simplifySlug()\" --\u003e SimpleSlug[Simple Slug]\n    SimpleSlug --\"pathToRoot()\"--\u003e Relative\n    SimpleSlug --\"resolveRelative()\" --\u003e Relative\n    MD{{Markdown File}} --\u003e FilePath{{File Path}} \u0026 Links[Markdown links]\n    Links --\"transformLink()\"--\u003e Relative\n    FilePath --\"slugifyFilePath()\"--\u003e FullSlug[Full Slug]\n    style FullSlug stroke-width:4px\n```\n\nHere are the main types of slugs with a rough description of each type of path:\n\n- `FilePath`: a real file path to a file on disk. Cannot be relative and must have a file extension.\n- `FullSlug`: cannot be relative and may not have leading or trailing slashes. It can have `index` as it's last segment. Use this wherever possible is it's the most 'general' interpretation of a slug.\n- `SimpleSlug`: cannot be relative and shouldn't have `/index` as an ending or a file extension. It _can_ however have a trailing slash to indicate a folder path.\n- `RelativeURL`: must start with `.` or `..` to indicate it's a relative URL. Shouldn't have `/index` as an ending or a file extension but can contain a trailing slash.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of how these relate to each other, take a look at the path tests in `quartz/util/path.test.ts`.\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.079831356Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/docs/features":{"title":"Feature List","content":"","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.080831366Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/docs/features/Docker-Support":{"title":"Docker Support","content":"\nQuartz comes shipped with a Docker image that will allow you to preview your Quartz locally without installing Node.\n\nYou can run the below one-liner to run Quartz in Docker.\n\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -itp 8080:8080 $(docker build -q .)\n```\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.079831356Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/docs/features/Latex":{"title":"LaTeX","content":"\nQuartz uses [Katex](https://katex.org/) by default to typeset both inline and block math expressions at build time.\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Block Math\n\nBlock math can be rendered by delimiting math expression with `$$`.\n\n```\n$$\nf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi\n$$\n```\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na \u0026= b + c \\\\ \u0026= e + f \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \u0026 2 \u0026 3 \\\\\na \u0026 b \u0026 c\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rll}\nE \\psi \u0026= H\\psi \u0026 \\text{Expanding the Hamiltonian Operator} \\\\\n\u0026= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\psi + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega x^2 \\psi \u0026 \\text{Using the ansatz $\\psi(x) = e^{-kx^2}f(x)$, hoping to cancel the $x^2$ term} \\\\\n\u0026= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} [4k^2x^2f(x)+2(-2kx)f'(x) + f''(x)]e^{-kx^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega x^2 f(x)e^{-kx^2} \u0026\\text{Removing the $e^{-kx^2}$ term from both sides} \\\\\n\u0026 \\Downarrow \\\\\nEf(x) \u0026= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} [4k^2x^2f(x)-4kxf'(x) + f''(x)] + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega x^2 f(x) \u0026 \\text{Choosing $k=\\frac{im}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\hbar}}$ to cancel the $x^2$ term, via $-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}4k^2=\\frac{1}{2}m \\omega$} \\\\\n\u0026= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} [-4kxf'(x) + f''(x)] \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n\u003e [!warn]\n\u003e Due to limitations in the [underlying parsing library](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math), block math in Quartz requires the `$$` delimiters to be on newlines like above.\n\n### Inline Math\n\nSimilarly, inline math can be rendered by delimiting math expression with a single `$`.

The **repository is [public](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#making-a-repository-public)**, otherwise visitors will not be able to view the discussion.\n2. The **[giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus) app is installed**, otherwise visitors will not be able to comment and react.\n3. The **Discussions feature is turned on** by [enabling it for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository).\n\nThen, use the [Giscus site](https://giscus.app/#repository) to figure out what your `repoId` and `categoryId` should be. Make sure you select `Announcements` for the Discussion category.\n\n![[giscus-repo.png]]\n\n![[giscus-discussion.png]]\n\nAfter entering both your repository and selecting the discussion category, Giscus will compute some IDs that you'll need to provide back to Quartz. You won't need to manually add the script yourself as Quartz will handle that part for you but will need these values in the next step!\n\n![[giscus-results.png]]\n\nFinally, in `quartz.layout.ts`, edit the `afterBody` field of `sharedPageComponents` to include the following options but with the values you got from above:\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nafterBody: [\n  Component.Comments({\n    provider: 'giscus',\n    options: {\n      // from data-repo\n      repo: 'jackyzha0/quartz',\n      // from data-repo-id\n      repoId: 'MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODcyMTMyMDg',\n      // from data-category\n      category: 'Announcements',\n      // from data-category-id\n      categoryId: 'DIC_kwDOFxRnmM4B-Xg6',\n    }\n  }),\n],\n```\n\n### Customization\n\nQuartz also exposes a few of the other Giscus options as well and you can provide them the same way `repo`, `repoId`, `category`, and `categoryId` are provided.\n\n```ts\ntype Options = {\n  provider: \"giscus\"\n  options: {\n    repo: `${string}/${string}`\n    repoId: string\n    category: string\n    categoryId: string\n\n    // Url to folder with custom themes\n    // defaults to 'https://${cfg.baseUrl}/static/giscus'\n    themeUrl?: string\n\n    // filename for light theme .css file\n    // defaults to 'light'\n    lightTheme?: string\n\n    // filename for dark theme .css file\n    // defaults to 'dark'\n    darkTheme?: string\n\n    // how to map pages -\u003e discussions\n    // defaults to 'url'\n    mapping?: \"url\" | \"title\" | \"og:title\" | \"specific\" | \"number\" | \"pathname\"\n\n    // use strict title matching\n    // defaults to true\n    strict?: boolean\n\n    // whether to enable reactions for the main post\n    // defaults to true\n    reactionsEnabled?: boolean\n\n    // where to put the comment input box relative to the comments\n    // defaults to 'bottom'\n    inputPosition?: \"top\" | \"bottom\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Custom CSS theme\n\nQuartz supports custom theme for Giscus. To use a custom CSS theme, place the `.css` file inside the `quartz/static` folder and set the configuration values.\n\nFor example, if you have a light theme `light-theme.css`, a dark theme `dark-theme.css`, and your Quartz site is hosted at `https://example.com/`:\n\n```ts\nafterBody: [\n  Component.Comments({\n    provider: 'giscus',\n    options: {\n      // Other options\n\n      themeUrl: \"https://example.com/static/giscus\", // corresponds to quartz/static/giscus/\n      lightTheme: \"light-theme\", // corresponds to light-theme.css in quartz/static/giscus/\n      darkTheme: \"dark-theme\", // corresponds to dark-theme.css quartz/static/giscus/\n    }\n  }),\n],\n```\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.079831356Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/docs/features/darkmode":{"title":"Darkmode","content":"\nQuartz supports darkmode out of the box that respects the user's theme preference.

It supports nested folders and is highly customizable.\n\nBy default, it shows all folders and files on your page. To display the explorer in a different spot, you can edit the [[layout]].\n\nDisplay names for folders get determined by the `title` frontmatter field in `folder/index.md` (more detail in [[authoring content | Authoring Content]]). If this file does not exist or does not contain frontmatter, the local folder name will be used instead.\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e The explorer uses local storage by default to save the state of your explorer. This is done to ensure a smooth experience when navigating to different pages.\n\u003e\n\u003e To clear/delete the explorer state from local storage, delete the `fileTree` entry (guide on how to delete a key from local storage in chromium based browsers can be found [here](https://docs.devolutions.net/kb/general-knowledge-base/clear-browser-local-storage/clear-chrome-local-storage/)). You can disable this by passing `useSavedState: false` as an argument.\n\n## Customization\n\nMost configuration can be done by passing in options to `Component.Explorer()`.\n\nFor example, here's what the default configuration looks like:\n\n```typescript title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  title: \"Explorer\", // title of the explorer component\n  folderClickBehavior: \"collapse\", // what happens when you click a folder (\"link\" to navigate to folder page on click or \"collapse\" to collapse folder on click)\n  folderDefaultState: \"collapsed\", // default state of folders (\"collapsed\" or \"open\")\n  useSavedState: true, // whether to use local storage to save \"state\" (which folders are opened) of explorer\n  // Sort order: folders first, then files.

You can pass a custom `sort`, `filter` and `map` function.\nAll functions you can pass work with the `FileNode` class, which has the following properties:\n\n```ts title=\"quartz/components/ExplorerNode.tsx\" {2-5}\nexport class FileNode {\n  children: FileNode[]  // children of current node\n  name: string  // last part of slug\n  displayName: string // what actually should be displayed in the explorer\n  file: QuartzPluginData | null // if node is a file, this is the file's metadata. See `QuartzPluginData` for more detail\n  depth: number // depth of current node\n\n  ... // rest of implementation\n}\n```\n\nEvery function you can pass is optional. By default, only a `sort` function will be used:\n\n```ts title=\"Default sort function\"\n// Sort order: folders first, then files. Sort folders and files alphabetically\nComponent.Explorer({\n  sortFn: (a, b) =\u003e {\n    if ((!a.file \u0026\u0026 !b.file) || (a.file \u0026\u0026 b.file)) {\n      // sensitivity: \"base\": Only strings that differ in base letters compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a = á, a = A\n      // numeric: true: Whether numeric collation should be used, such that \"1\" \u003c \"2\" \u003c \"10\"\n      return a.displayName.localeCompare(b.displayName, undefined, {\n        numeric: true,\n        sensitivity: \"base\",\n      })\n    }\n    if (a.file \u0026\u0026 !b.file) {\n      return 1\n    } else {\n      return -1\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\n---\n\nYou can pass your own functions for `sortFn`, `filterFn` and `mapFn`. All functions will be executed in the order provided by the `order` option (see [[#Customization]]). These functions behave similarly to their `Array.prototype` counterpart, except they modify the entire `FileNode` tree in place instead of returning a new one.\n\nFor more information on how to use `sort`, `filter` and `map`, you can check [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort), [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) and [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).\n\nType definitions look like this:\n\n```ts\nsortFn: (a: FileNode, b: FileNode) =\u003e number\nfilterFn: (node: FileNode) =\u003e boolean\nmapFn: (node: FileNode) =\u003e void\n```\n\n\u003e [!tip]\n\u003e You can check if a `FileNode` is a folder or a file like this:\n\u003e\n\u003e ```ts\n\u003e if (node.file) {\n\u003e   // node is a file\n\u003e } else {\n\u003e   // node is a folder\n\u003e }\n\u003e ```\n\n## Basic examples\n\nThese examples show the basic usage of `sort`, `map` and `filter`.\n\n### Use `sort` to put files first\n\nUsing this example, the explorer will alphabetically sort everything, but put all **files** above all **folders**.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  sortFn: (a, b) =\u003e {\n    if ((!a.file \u0026\u0026 !b.file) || (a.file \u0026\u0026 b.file)) {\n      return a.displayName.localeCompare(b.displayName)\n    }\n    if (a.file \u0026\u0026 !b.file) {\n      return -1\n    } else {\n      return 1\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Change display names (`map`)\n\nUsing this example, the display names of all `FileNodes` (folders + files) will be converted to full upper case.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  mapFn: (node) =\u003e {\n    node.displayName = node.displayName.toUpperCase()\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Remove list of elements (`filter`)\n\nUsing this example, you can remove elements from your explorer by providing an array of folders/files using the `omit` set.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: (node) =\u003e {\n    // set containing names of everything you want to filter out\n    const omit = new Set([\"authoring content\", \"tags\", \"hosting\"])\n    return !omit.has(node.name.toLowerCase())\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can customize this by changing the entries of the `omit` set. Simply add all folder or file names you want to remove.\n\n### Remove files by tag\n\nYou can access the frontmatter of a file by `node.file?.frontmatter?`. This allows you to filter out files based on their frontmatter, for example by their tags.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: (node) =\u003e {\n    // exclude files with the tag \"explorerexclude\"\n    return node.file?.frontmatter?.tags?.includes(\"explorerexclude\") !== true\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Show every element in explorer\n\nTo override the default filter function that removes the `tags` folder from the explorer, you can set the filter function to `undefined`.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: undefined, // apply no filter function, every file and folder will visible\n})\n```\n\n## Advanced examples\n\n\u003e [!tip]\n\u003e When writing more complicated functions, the `layout` file can start to look very cramped.\n\u003e You can fix this by defining your functions in another file.\n\u003e\n\u003e ```ts title=\"functions.ts\"\n\u003e import { Options } from \"./quartz/components/ExplorerNode\"\n\u003e export const mapFn: Options[\"mapFn\"] = (node) =\u003e {\n\u003e   // implement your function here\n\u003e }\n\u003e export const filterFn: Options[\"filterFn\"] = (node) =\u003e {\n\u003e   // implement your function here\n\u003e }\n\u003e export const sortFn: Options[\"sortFn\"] = (a, b) =\u003e {\n\u003e   // implement your function here\n\u003e }\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e You can then import them like this:\n\u003e\n\u003e ```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\n\u003e import { mapFn, filterFn, sortFn } from \"./functions.ts\"\n\u003e Component.Explorer({\n\u003e   mapFn: mapFn,\n\u003e   filterFn: filterFn,\n\u003e   sortFn: sortFn,\n\u003e })\n\u003e ```\n\n### Add emoji prefix\n\nTo add emoji prefixes (📁 for folders, 📄 for files), you could use a map function like this:\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  mapFn: (node) =\u003e {\n    // dont change name of root node\n    if (node.depth \u003e 0) {\n      // set emoji for file/folder\n      if (node.file) {\n        node.displayName = \"📄 \" + node.displayName\n      } else {\n        node.displayName = \"📁 \" + node.displayName\n      }\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nIn this example, we're going to customize the explorer by using functions from examples above to [[#Add emoji prefix | add emoji prefixes]], [[#remove-list-of-elements-filter| filter out some folders]] and [[#use-sort-to-put-files-first | sort with files above folders]].\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: sampleFilterFn,\n  mapFn: sampleMapFn,\n  sortFn: sampleSortFn,\n  order: [\"filter\", \"sort\", \"map\"],\n})\n```\n\nNotice how we customized the `order` array here. This is done because the default order applies the `sort` function last. While this normally works well, it would cause unintended behavior here, since we changed the first characters of all display names. In our example, `sort` would be applied based off the emoji prefix instead of the first _real_ character.\n\nTo fix this, we just changed around the order and apply the `sort` function before changing the display names in the `map` function.\n\n### Use `sort` with pre-defined sort order\n\nHere's another example where a map containing file/folder names (as slugs) is used to define the sort order of the explorer in quartz. All files/folders that aren't listed inside of `nameOrderMap` will appear at the top of that folders hierarchy level.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning, that the smaller the number set in `nameOrderMap`, the higher up the entry will be in the explorer. Incrementing every folder/file by 100, makes ordering files in their folders a lot easier. Lastly, this example still allows you to use a `mapFn` or frontmatter titles to change display names, as it uses slugs for `nameOrderMap` (which is unaffected by display name changes).\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  sortFn: (a, b) =\u003e {\n    const nameOrderMap: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e = {\n      \"poetry-folder\": 100,\n      \"essay-folder\": 200,\n      \"research-paper-file\": 201,\n      \"dinosaur-fossils-file\": 300,\n      \"other-folder\": 400,\n    }\n\n    let orderA = 0\n    let orderB = 0\n\n    if (a.file \u0026\u0026 a.file.slug) {\n      orderA = nameOrderMap[a.file.slug] || 0\n    } else if (a.name) {\n      orderA = nameOrderMap[a.name] || 0\n    }\n\n    if (b.file \u0026\u0026 b.file.slug) {\n      orderB = nameOrderMap[b.file.slug] || 0\n    } else if (b.name) {\n      orderB = nameOrderMap[b.name] || 0\n    }\n\n    return orderA - orderB\n  },\n})\n```\n\nFor reference, this is how the quartz explorer window would look like with that example:\n\n```\n📖 Poetry Folder\n📑 Essay Folder\n    ⚗️ Research Paper File\n🦴 Dinosaur Fossils File\n🔮 Other Folder\n```\n\nAnd this is how the file structure would look like:\n\n```\nindex.md\npoetry-folder\n    index.md\nessay-folder\n    index.md\n    research-paper-file.md\ndinosaur-fossils-file.md\nother-folder\n    index.md\n```\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.079831356Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/docs/features/folder-and-tag-listings":{"title":"Folder and Tag Listings","content":"\nQuartz emits listing pages for any folders and tags you have.\n\n## Folder Listings\n\nQuartz will generate an index page for all the pages under that folder. This includes any content that is multiple levels deep.\n\nAdditionally, Quartz will also generate pages for subfolders. Say you have a note in a nested folder `content/abc/def/note.md`. Then Quartz would generate a page for all the notes under `abc` _and_ a page for all the notes under `abc/def`.\n\nYou can link to the folder listing by referencing its name, plus a trailing slash, like this: `[[advanced/]]` (results in [[advanced/]]).\n\nBy default, Quartz will title the page `Folder: \u003cfolder name\u003e` and no description. You can override this by creating an `index.md` file in the folder with the `title` [[authoring content#Syntax|frontmatter]] field. Any content you write in this file will also be used in the folder description.\n\nFor example, for the folder `content/posts`, you can add another file `content/posts/index.md` to add a specific description for it.\n\n## Tag Listings\n\nQuartz will also create an index page for each unique tag in your vault and render a list of all notes with that tag.\n\nQuartz also supports tag hierarchies as well (e.g. `plugin/emitter`) and will also render a separate tag page for each level of the tag hierarchy. It will also create a default global tag index page at `/tags` that displays a list of all the tags in your Quartz.\n\nYou can link to the tag listing by referencing its name with a `tag/` prefix, like this: `[[tags/plugin]]` (results in [[tags/plugin]]).\n\nAs with folder listings, you can also provide a description and title for a tag page by creating a file for each tag.

RPMs will help us share the expectations for hardware health with their teams. \n\nNew Zoku allocations will land in January post-break (@carpus). Users will see numbers with a slight buffer to allow for hardware health events, as well as target healthy nodes  and billable nodes that reflect the HWH SLA and the total number of nodes-per-island (sourcing directly from ndb, ty @leochen!)  Zoku allocations will be set higher than the number RPMs plan against - so users can benefit from extra healthy nodes. Any healthy nodes above the Zoku allocation can be used as flex\n(@jos). For future #.compute-support requests, HWH team will keep clusters above the planned SLA, but for questions about extra nodes above SLA please point them to our overallocation explanation (. For clusters out of SLA we'll track via sev. \n\nAppreciate the feedback from everyone - @shantanu @jos @natan @leochen @mengqingw @angelafan @carpus @kenny @saagarp - and there's definitely more to consider in terms of tracking our HWH SLAs or increasing the buffer we provide on Zoku. We'll iterate the numbers based on feedback from next compute cycle.\n\n\n\nUnified Maintenance \n\n\nUnified-maintenance view - We've consolidated all our maintenances (5 spreadsheets across CSPs) into one Sigma table view on go/maintenances. Here you can find maintenance schedules for the next 2 months (as well as prev maintenances for the curious).

If you haven't seen this masterpiece you MUST go see it. \n\nIn one scene of A24's 2022 smash hit, the camera pans out to reveal protagonist Evelyn, slumped against a long table cluttered with papers. Thoughts of laundry and taxes and family and husbands and failed opportunities violently attack her mind, until we hear her heart beating and her vision go dizzy. A black title card emboldened with \"Everything\" explodes onto screen. \n\nI enjoy movies that make me feel. And boy, did that movie make me feel—and think—a lot. In the big picture, the movie discusses nihilism, chaos theory, and intergenerational trauma, all topics right up my alley. Zoom in and the scenes are scarily accurate parallels to my reality. When Evelyn saw her many potential lives splayed in front of her, I viscerally felt her agony, as she overturned every previous decision in her life and how it led her to what she thought was the worst timeline. I'm drawn to this narrative because it's a frequent taunt in the back of my mind, and I love seeing how different media abstract this human strife. Like Esther describing the fig tree in the \"Bell Jar.\" \n\nRegarding nihilism, this movie also paints a bittersweet outlook that I think is the closest to optimism and realism. Yes, nothing matters, but that's the point! If nothing matters, then *everything* matters—everything that you want to matter. I love seeing the world as a googly eye, the ying to the otherwise bleary yang. Of course this level of optimism is also an oversimplification of life, but as someone who has been overwhelmed by the sheer sensory overload of [living in the internet](Social Media.md), living in this interconnected world, it gives me something to look forward to. That the randomness of life makes it scary and chaotic, but also gives it beauty. \n\nThere are lingering thoughts in my mind. The tension between the mother and daughter, but also how my own mom hated the movie when she watched it. Existential dread and how it's a pit that has no end. \n\nIn the future, I hope we abandon the \"half-empty/half-full\" question in favor of this: do you see the world as a googly eye? Or a bagel? \n\nAnd I hope EEAO inspires us to choose the former.

Here is what we are proposing:**Before:** Non-critical priority jobs can overflow out of their targeted quota, not bound by the location the quota was restricted to.  \n**After:** All jobs (critical or non-critical) need to target either ‘quota’ or ‘flex’. When targeting a quota, jobs will not leave that quota’s location restrictions, and will not be able to overflow outside of the quota**Before:** Availability capacity in Zoku / `brix capacity` shows all theoretical availability, including out-of-quota capacity at non-critical priorities.  \n**After:** Zoku / `brix capacity` show in-quota and flex separately (e.g. run `brix capacity flex` to see unused GPUs in the cluster)**Before:** Sibling quotas can borrow from each other in case there’s unused GPUs, before overflowing out of quota.  \n**After:** If there is capacity in a sibling quota, related quotas will be able to schedule in it - but this is separate from flex and will never go beyond the entire quota tree's availability.The single way to use unused GPUs in a cluster will be to target the `flex` quota that exists in each cluster and is the summation of all unused capacity across all quotas in that cluster. Jobs running on flex will be preempted by in-quota jobs being spun up. When scheduling on flex, the priority of your job only applies within your namespace, and namespaces are treated equally. We believe this new quota system will be much easier to understand for everyone - less confusion about why something doesn’t schedule, a clear path to finding free capacity across the fleet (just check flex!), and less edge cases for us to worry about when building the scheduling systems.Please provide your feedback about the current or proposed scheduling system to us in this thread ![:thread:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f9f5@2x.png).

feel rlly alone\n* i wish i could have a happy medium !!! we would end up in the same city and i wouldnt have to \"\"fight'\" for a relationship so early on \n* rlly fighting the delulu thought that \"if he is truly the right person we'll find a way back together again\" bc logistically he wouldnt have moved to nyc unless i showed commitment \u0026\u0026 i already stayed firm in my decision to give up on us :C\n* i mean i feel like this indecision is a good sign of why i gave this relationship a shot!\n* its crazy during the breakup process i didnt see a future for ourselves and now that im not thinking about the logistics im able to think about the what ifs rlly seriously \n\n\n- conclusion: me \u0026 all my friends are looking at the same situation and trying to make sense of it using our own prev experiences and biases and will come to diff conclusions \n\n\n10/26/23\n- we're all confused in this life and making decisions that we'll never know if they're making mistakes or not!!

WHAT IF I HOP ON A FLIGHT TO BERKELEY IN THANKSGIVING AND BEG HIM TO TAKE ME BACK \n* i think the problem is that im a dismissive avoidant type person who once i take a solo trip/disance myself/feel the commitment of a relationship increasing i push away\n* i have a hypersensitivity to body language from eric\n* realization: i developed a fearful avoidant personality after eric \n\t* randomly break up when commitment becomes too high \n\t* honestly the only thing i regret is getting into a relationship knowing that there were so many factors against us \n* w will — when the commitment to each other got too big instead of setting boundaries i would just ghost / cut him out \n\n11.2.23:\n* dear annie: \n* you have been through so much in the past 2 years—transferring between colleges, doubting yourself, regretting your decisions, getting in and out of breakups. you see love around you and you wish you could feel the same way. you know it exists. remember takeways from friends: when you lose something you gain something. you dont owe anyone a relationship. forgive yourself, because you know how you lose yourself in a relationship. you also know what feels right and love should come easily to you. annie, you are always learning and practicing how to stand up for yourself. from telling boys to wear cond* ms to telling them upfront your expectations out of a relationship , do not waver or let them convince you otherwise. \n\n* dear curtis,\n* i wish so much love for you. i hurt you, and i gave up on you, and i also tried so hard with you. i gave myself every moment to delay decision with you. and i know you would have worked with me. you met me at the wrong time. i went into it wanting you to pass in and out of my life. and i am so sad bc i know you would work so hard to build something beautiful together but it requires an effort that i dont want to commit to right now. i miss you \u0026 love you most on the verge of missing you, but nothing to that level when i am with you. \n\nnothing triggers me more than being unable to communicate my feelings\n— trying to explain how i feel to my mom in chinese bout my break up and being unable to find words \n— trying to explain to eric my feelings and getting shut down\n— trying to explain to curtis my boundaries and getting convinced \ni do not dream of labor \n\ngoogle search results:\n\"how do i get over breaking up with my bf because we would we long distance for 2 years and i dont see this going anywhere but he was such a good guy\"\n\n11/11/23\n* finally (it better be) settling my feelings and what if's to rest with curtis\n* reached out for ONE MORE CALL bc i kept feeling like i made the wrong decision\n* i think we fundamentally are soo diff hes a self proclaimed workaholic (accurate) and i rlly value my wlb \n* and when i was honest and vulnerable that i get anxious and feel like i was a fearful avoidant who like ran away when things got serious and asked to get back together he says as much as he wants to hes gonna say know bc \n\t* 1) he is not in a good place to be in a relaitonship rn, hes super busy (i know if we stayed together he would try to balance it both but he would be mia during the weekdays and only b able to talk on weekends)\n\t\t* generally hes moving at a pace where he rlly wants to work \n\t\t* and i think as much as im attraced to a workaholic it means its hard to build a future togetehr\n\t\t* he also would be prioritizing career and wont move to nyc unless it makes sense w an in person role, and i dont think that chance would come until 2+ years, and maintaining a LDR on top of that is unsustainable \n\t* 2) i ran at the first sign of conflict / trouble in the relationship and yeah thats on me tbh i ant rlly argue against that lOL\n\t\t* i mean i already conceded i dont thnk im at a good palce to be in a relationship \n\t\t* i only reaffirmed that w what i said\n\t\t* for us to build a relationship w me not 100% convinced \n* lasting serotonin of being able to talk to him one more time but I KNOW its so bad for the both of us\n* i dont rlly care about having an \"impressive bf\" as much as a bf who i liek and lieks me\n* icks:\n\t* the picture of him at halloween is kinda cray LMAOOO \n\t* his hands still abnormally small\n\t* face still abrnomally small over cam\n\t* def pushed my boundaries in a way i wasnt comfy w \n\t*

This might seem obvious, but as Weatherby makes clear, some linguists insist that LLMs are _not_ producing language. T**his is the view of Noam Chomsky, whom Weatherby uses to illustrate what he calls the “syntax” view of language, which proposes that language is located in the brain, meaning there is some underlying biological, cognitive structure that allows us to use language—a “universal grammar**.” From this view, LLMs don’t produce language but rather a pale imitation of it, as they lack the underlying cognitive function that would give rise to language. This scientific view of language, which seems to me to be a sort of biological determinism, leaves us ill equipped to understand the output of LLMs, as all it can do is say, “that’s not language,” dismissing the matter as someone else’s concern.\n- “statistics” view, prevalent among some computational linguists, which says that we “know a word by the company it keeps.” Proponents of this view _do_ believe that LLMs produce language, and they view LLMs as vindication for their view of language, since these models work by using statistical relationships among words to produce the next word in a sequence, generating sentences that are often indistinguishable from human language\n- Neither the syntax view nor the statistics view is satisfactory for Weatherby’s goals, however; if the syntax view ignores the output of LLMs in search of a natural source for language, then the statistics view focuses too much on the output of these machines, ignoring the search for an explanatory theory of language\n- “great rationalization” here is analogous to the shift Weatherby outlines from the humanities to the sciences, and the idea that language “communicate[s] our thoughts, feelings and intentions” is based on the idea that language is referential—first we have something inside or outside of ourselves, which exists before language, and then we convey that information in language. This explanation assumes that reference is the primary function of language—an idea Weatherby calls the “ladder of reference”—with other functions, such as the poetic function, built on top. Weatherby disagrees with this idea, claiming that LLMs show language to be poetic first and referential second; in other words, since LLMs cannot refer to the external, physical world—only its representation in language—an LLM can never escape language, meaning it can never be primarily referential","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.090831468Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/overallocation-team-call":{"title":"overallocation team call","content":"\n- kick off how we can address this overallocation problem \n- we have discussed this at some level one-on-one\n- talk thru the semantics of how \n![[Pasted image 20251030131048.png]]\n\nRE: Rollout Plan.

30 min from texas\neverything is bigger in texas\n\ni've never been to texas - everything truly is bigger. for dinner we get massive entrees of fish laden in butter and a greek salad with an entire block of feta. beer comes in a heavy chalice, fit for a medieval prince. the rental car we get is a kia. dfw resembles a heart, with several ventricles and connectiosn to the rest of america. \n\nid imagine in a place with such abundance, it is very easy to believe in a god that granted us this gift. that you simultaneously find purpose in driving down the road and tending to your land, that you are feasting from the land you live on. \n\n**why texas?**\n- practical - tax benefits\n\t- Texas [offers a sales tax abatement](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/data-centers) on equipment and electricity for data centers that are at least 100,000 square feet, invest at least $200 million and employ at least 20 people at above-average wages from the county where the data center is located, according to the state comptroller.\n\t- space\n\t- power grid\n\t\t- The council’s decisions in August and November have come at a time when experts [are warning that Texas’ power grid faces](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/21/nx-s1-5002265/texas-power-grid-is-challenged-by-electricity-loving-computer-data-centers) new strains from a growing tech sector of data centers for AI computing and crypto mining with expectations to consume record levels of energy.\ni wonder what is like to see this open space used for something so incomprehensible, somethign ununderstandable. \n\nif the airport is the heart we were doing a short drive to the brain, a gpu datacenter.\n\nin our trip to texas my coworker insists we go to buckees. im from jersey so i udnerstand the cult lov for a grocery store it must be like nj. \n\nwe go to buckee's which is the classic hallmark of americana - they are carving meats in the middle and there are gas station stalls for days. at some point they stop and recite a pledge. there is packaged banana pudding and buckees nuggets (which someone mistakenly refers to as nuts) and wall of beef jerkey, next to a meat counter of choose your own jerkey.\ngas is $3 and no one is at the station. if you wander past the cute animals there is a section reserved for guns. it's a combination gas station grocery store.\n\nwild west shutdown except its group of silicon valley engineers vs local dc techs. i am grateful for this opportunity for perspective. \n\nwhen my parents immigrated to america they expected the plains of virginia, the country roads. \n\na beaver stares at you from pajama pants, from towels, from water bottles. truly if there is a need there is a object, and even if there is not a need one is invented. \n\nthere are details of which i cannot describe in detail \n\ninfrastructure is the backbone of this economy. the brain of america may exist at the coasts but the veins exist in the railroads, datacenters, and factories. \n\ni wear steel toed boots to save space in my backpack, which means they alert the security when i pass through, twice. i dither at my closet door, unsure what to wear - will it be cold? warm? construction worker fashion chic? i settle on a jean jacket and flared leggings to pair with the timberlands i expensed for this trip. \n\nthere is a certain swagger i cannot plan for. \n\nbut there is publicly available information \nin a way visiting a dc feels post-economic \n\nyou go into a room with this many coreweave folks and you realize everyone makes so much money \n\nthere are stickers on their hard hats, inside jokes im sure they made over a pint of beer.\nlots of jeans, swagger, flannel\n\nwho are the people building the data centers? \nthese dc techs - it's hard work, to switch out a r ack is 30 pounds. \n\nin a way it is a computer that is so large in scale it needs humans to manually replace thigns\n\na coworker comments that the price of external hard drives have gone up bc of the demand for ssds, which store information for the model weights. given the choice of a photo of your cat vs the entire catalog of the internet since the 80s, what would you pick? \n\n**to explain a gpu:**\nnvidias nvl72 is a system of 72 nodes, aka 8 racks, connected to 8 nvl racks. it comprises of cpus which do more high-paced low storage work. fiber networking connects these racks to each other within a row, which in turn communicates across an entire ib fabric. \n\n**to explain a datacenter**\n\n- its a herculean physical undertaking \n- just construction wise - foundation piles, structural steel, underground cables, mechanical pipping\n- extremely fast networking, fast connections\nthere are hundreds of wires metculously ziptied together.\nbehind them they are connected to a power source, which are thick knots of wires.\n\nthese salient physical features of a gpu evolve from engineering constraitns and needs for throughput, speed, latency, and power.\n\n\ni think of the scene of the matrix when humans are connected to these huge computers via wire.\n\nwhat are the neighboring effects\n- are most data centers colo w the power plants - most of neighboring community impact comes from pwoer generation and not data cente ritself - does dc itself have cooling needs and water needs \n- - internet concerns about water needs - but data center is not as substantial % \n- a lot of real estate construction startups are all like data center construction - who are the blue collar ppl who are in demnad to build all the data centers and transmission nad power plants\n\t- what would it take for american tehc workers to go back to these jobs instead of idolizing our shinty 9 - 5 \n- are dcs bringing back factory towns?\nwe talk a lot with the leadership and program managers who own the data center, less so the actual workers who work there. there is soemone filing a jira ticket with hsi laptop open. \nthere are no chairs so they sit on the ground to type on their computer\nthere is a back room where dell actually services and repairs the racks. \n\nit actually takes way more technicians to build up a datacenter vs service it. \nthis is such a specialized skill that its hard to hire for. \ni wonder how dc techs hear about these jobs - there are many signs in russian and apparently there is a consultancy of russian dc techs woh can do the job efficiently\n\ni think we react so defensively to data centers bc we are already so desniized to the infra needed for the cloud. even to operate an website or app that connects to aws, ur talking about investments in the orders of millinos. to build your phone relies on supply chain sophistication across huge factories with little to no min wage.\nbut then again, cloud runs many independent workloads at once, whereas an ai datacenter serves as one large computer.\ni wonder why we do not react to this with the same awe we give to a skyscraper, which equally uses as many resources and takes up as much as space. maybe because it is a blight in an otherwise void of vastnesss - maybe bc it doesnt provide sanctuary for humans but rather nodes - maybe because we are awed by vertical height but its the horiztonal vastness that scares us. \n\ni am writing this bc there is power in knowledge \n\nlook at your computer. imagine every time you rebooted your macbook because someone was restarting someone had to physical walk down the aisle and power evertything off. \n\nthis is a story that is deeply american built on eastern technology.\n\n\nthere are fans from the gb200s that means that i cannot hear whats going on. \nback at my old job, i interacted with dc techs only via teams call. \n\nwe open a gpu tray but the coveted nvl tray is seaeld shut, with the only way to service by senidng back to nvidia. trade secrets, im sure.  it reminds me of how we cant open my iphone to fix it.\n\ni imagine there is something about having a physical hardware piece of technology that lures people into this field of work, akin to fixing up a car or being into boats and transportation. an old boss cited video games and taking apart gaming computers as what led him to his work. \nthe same way the texans are proud of their cars, or the people of the war took apart radios to understand how they work. every generation there exists some hardware that fascinates us.\n\nwhat would it be like to go to a chip factory, where you fabricating something at the dimension of nanoseconds?\n\nat home my sister shows me her gpu that she ordered online. its about a k and feels plastic and cheap despite weighnig 5 pounds. the chinese just dumped some expensive gpus insdie a shitty cover, we say. we train a local model (llama iii) and try to fine tune it. \"recommend a korean restauratn to us\"\n\ni think for me it was a loose fascination with space and rockets. \n\n\nthe gb200 is a beautiful beast. \n72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, tied together in a single NVLink domain that delivers 1.8 terabytes of GPU-to-GPU bandwidth and gives every GPU access to 14 terabytes of pooled memory. Rather than behaving like dozens of separate chips, the rack operates as a single, giant accelerator, capable of processing an astonishing 865,000 tokens per second\nnetworking topology - NVLink and NVSwitch at terabytes per second, collapsing memory and bandwidth barriers\nAzure uses both InfiniBand and Ethernet fabrics that deliver 800 Gbps, in a full fat tree non-blocking architecture to ensure that every GPU can talk to every other GPU at full line rate without congestion\nwe drive into an undescripit area that defies description - \nwant to ask - what \ncoreweave \n\nim curious by this and the car factories, and how they implement jit adn kaizen \nthe intricaties has increased exponentially - its not going down a chain but there is an intricate dance to every operation \n\nwe look thru several rooms\n- the gpu room there is a security check before you can enter \n- its dark \n- the nodes glitter and pulse like emerald eyes in a cave \n- each rack weighs XX pounds \n- they tell us about the facility but my ears are muffled, so trying to understand is like answers a fill in the blank question when you dont know the options \npretty dark \n\n260 MW of power\n- each building has ~40 of rows, with each row having 8 racks\n- they also have 7 spare warm racks (the last row) in each building they use for spares and triage\n- the rows are labeled \u003cbuilding letter\u003e\u003c2 digit row number\u003e\u003crack index\u003e, which is a very nice schema and maps neatly onto ours (we'd just replace the letter with the corresponding number)\n- they're also adamant about calling them nvlink domains, not racks (just like our scaleup domains)\n- ear protection was mandatory and everyone inside was wearing some form of it. They were pretty adamanant about this and mentioned OSHA. Big constrast with OCI.\n- pretty neat cabling overall\n- they use trunk cables between buildings, but use standard fiber inside a building.\n- they're moving (seemingly quickly) from smc to dell for odm. Not a total switch but they seem to really prefer dell. The stated benefits are much stronger partnership with dell than smc, and more control over both repairs and provisioning than smc is willing to give them\n- - the average knowledge level of a cw tech on the floor seemed astronomically high \n- compared to other places I've seen\n\ngrowing up i felt a snese of disgust passing by the factoreis between nj and nyc which felt like economic deadzone\n\ntheres a symbolic malaise to factories and datacenters, even if they arguably produce higher economic output than ashiny \n\ndc tech \n- turn on/off gear, replacing hard drives, servicing\n- rack and stack - manual labor\n- cabling - incredibly tedious \n- low level config tickets \n- higher level config\n- network engineering setup \n- cable up full racks \n- cable hell\n\t- https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=cable+hell+data+center\u0026cId=b024c70a-181b-4f93-8d74-d3e354d7c7f5\u0026iId=8aa75bf7-2e01-4c98-a6c2-5849a991839a\n- Loud. Cold. Hot. Spaghetti maze. Heavy servers on bottom, lighter ones at top-SIKE, switch it around. Why is this UPS beeping\n- there are not that many permanent jobs - its ilke cleaning or security\n- a big job is actually security\n3 sys admins, 2 NOC operators, 1 CTO/CIO. 1 deckhand working 5/7, 9-5. External security company with 12 posts on property in total. I don't remember if those 12 were manned all the time. 2 cleaning ladies (external). 1 maintenance guy\n- sitting around witing for something to break \n- One guy at the top of the food chain lives 5 states away, 5 guys make $20/hr running around repluging shit and replacing parts mindlessly. data center is not that much different that say a high tech manufacturing plant. Electrical and mechanic people , some IT ops but it’s pretty low man power operations\n- Being a tech in those places is to rack and stack server \u0026 network equipment. Open boxes, unpack, plug in cables. Next!\n- All the actual setup is handled by designated sys admins (mostly offshore).\n\nprime real estate for housing \n- but A lot of these new data center areas are on plots of land that are not zoned for residential and would not be zoned for residential.\nPlus the rezoning process can take many months to years and most developers aren’t going to pay taxes on a piece of land that long just to be told the County decided not to rezone it anyways because it doesn’t work with their master plan.\nExact opposite, the datacenters bring in large amounts of money that allows Loudoun to have such nice schools, parks, very low property taxes, and the Sheriffs do not need to use tickets to makeup for budget shortfalls. Of course Loudoun also manages its datacenter development with a long term plan and has been doing so for something like two decades.\n\n\nthe economic output of a data center is difficult to discern. on one hand you'd imagine that it's the same as factories - invest millions and you net jobs for thousands of locals. the reality is a bit more complicated - it's not like a factory where each square foot is used by a worker, but rather more like a zoo where one person is walking up and down the hall to make sure the lions aren't fighting each other. \n\nlook to loundon as an example of an area with positive impact. data center taxes pay for 38% of Loudoun's general fund. By sq/ft they bring in the most taxes of any industry. The next best industry is hotels and you would need 8 datacenter sized hotels to bring in the same taxes as one datacenter. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1pezsl7/the_data_center_resistance_has_arrived/\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.091831478Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/potential-candidates-for-cluster-rollout":{"title":"potential candidates for cluster rollout","content":"\nunderallocated \n- argon\n\t- https://zoku.int.infra-sci.sci.openai.org/clusters/argon\n- argon-01c\n\t- https://zoku.int.infra-sci.sci.openai.org/clusters/argon-01c \nf15\n- 460 healthy \n- 381 assigned\n- 405 \n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.091831478Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/power-maintenance-titanium":{"title":"power maintenance titanium","content":"\nresearch action: **Spin down** workloads if required prior to maintenance `brix pause` (or `brix dequeue --pause` is job is in the queue).

It's fixed how many GPUs are needed for a 1 training run (i.e. 352 H200s needed for the train cluster for thinky model posttraining, we need a continuous block in an island for this, if we dip under that number due to unhealthy nodes then we simply can't complete the cluster for a training run, can't split across islands)Re team allocation, it's just an informal process to coordinate on the team, which teammates will use team-budget GPUs by spinning up engines/peashooter clusters on the available nodes. And we just discuss which folks need them for higher pri reasons. In general, everyone is responsible for their own jobs' nodes health - there isn't a dedicated person on the team who manages the health of the cluster.

We should move towards an automation driven state machine, removing humans from the loop as much as possible.\n\n# The Plan\n\nHere’s what the new flow is going to look like:\n\n1. [**Planned**] A new cluster is added to NCDB, via either the spreadsheet (go/gpu-supply) or go/em.\n2. [**Planned → Provisioning]** Our controller watches the subscription the cluster exists in. Once enough CPU quota is added by Azure for us to create a cluster, the controller marks the cluster as “Provisioning”.\n3. [**Provisioning → Provisioned**] We run a [buildkite job](https://buildkite.com/openai-mono/cluster-bootstrapper) that is responsible for performing the set of terraform applies and applied spec that we need to provision a new cluster\n    1. Why buildkite? Our controller doesn’t have access to github actions. And buildkite works well with the deploy systems, so it’s a reasonable choice for a stopgap. In the future, we should probably consolidate towards just the controller, or maybe temporal/similar.\n4. [**Provisioning → Provisioned**] Our controller creates the VMSSes for the cluster (via ASO).\n    1. Note that this state transition is the same as the previous one, that’ll probably change.\n    2. It may seem strange that we use ASO for VMSSes only. It is possible (perhaps likely) that we will use ASO to provision more and more of our resources.\n5. [**Provisioned → In production**] The cluster is now ready for validation. We should verify that:\n    1. Cluster health is green.\n    2. All applied services successfully deployed\n    3. All terraform projects + cross-cluster dependencies successfully applied\n\nAt the end of this, we should be able to create a cluster with two fairly minimal touches.\n\n1. Data entry into NCDB, for when the cluster first becomes known to us.\n2. Cluster check in (during step (3)).\n    1. For now, this is unavoidable since we need tf projects/other clusters to become aware of our cluster. There are ways to get around this; none of them super straightforward or easy.\n\nWe do want to eventually support zero bootstrap; it’s far more modern. The above approach should generalize, paving the path towards doing zero bootstrap with as few manual touches as monolithic.","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.092831488Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/sdai":{"title":"sdai","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.092831488Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/security-vulnerability":{"title":"security vulnerability","content":"\noci\n- Thanks for the summary, Kenny. Just to clarify, the threat model for this particular issue is the same on a shared RoCE backend physical fabric vs. single-tenant fabric because the vulnerability kill chain requires local host command execution privileges.

The way the bubbles explode white around you as you shoot into the dark. The light tickling as the air escapes back up across your skin.\n\nJust the pure physical joy of thrashing your arms around in water. To fill the kid’s buckets and throw it at the sun—the way the water falls apart into drops, and then into mist, the way a rainbow appears for a second and is gone.\n\nTo swim by the cliffs where sharpbills nest. To swim in the harbor with Maud. To swim in the tiny lagoons that form between the rocks on the beach. To swim in rivers.\n\nThere is something so frivolous about water. It makes you float like you are in outer space! And no matter what you do—whatever shape you make of yourself—it will instantly fit itself around you! \n\nWater didn’t have to be this good.\n\nYou forgot it for years while you lived in the city. But here it is: that one day in July when it storms but the water is lukewarm and you tumble inside the waves. You lose yourself in the sensation of being a body submerged in another body. Your back against the concrete pillar under the pier; the waves cresting, crashing over you—you can do this for hours. \n\nImagine living in a world without water. One day you read about a massive new installation of tactile art at MOMA. People are so psyched about it that you fly out across the Atlantic desert and queue for hours to see it for yourself.\n\n“Yes,” you would say, “the way it stretches as far as I can see, making a perfectly straight line at the horizon—it has something of the monumentality of an Anselm Kiefer installation. Quite nice. Made by a skilled craftsman, no doubt.”\n\nThere are creases on the surface, repeating, yet subtly varied—wait, the creases _move_. The creases, chasing each other, suddenly change color at their tips when they approach you: they become white, like the water is showing its teeth. \n\n“You can touch it,” the museum guard would say. \n\n“I can?”\n\n“Yes, you can even walk into the creases.”\n\nUnsure, you would take off your shoes and walk out into the surf, the water making your trousers heavy. Letting it run through your fingers, the texture of it would make you laugh.\n\n“Try jumping from the cliff over there,” the guard would say. “And then you shape yourself like a cannonball before you hit the surface.”\n\nYou would try it.\n\nIt would feel so good, the water, you would cry that stuff from your eyes.","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.093831498Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/tech/":{"title":"Tech","content":"","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.093831498Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/tech/BeReal":{"title":"BeReal","content":"\n![[Pasted image 20220725220029.png]]\nSource: OnlineOptimism\nBeReal is the post-pandemic answer to ambient noise \n\nPlatform social medias—the likes of Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram—have become bloated with features to the point of sensory overload. So it's not wonder that a little French app with an addictive gimmick has risen to the top of the app store.\n\nBeReal is a fairly barebones with only a few hard-set rules: at a random time, a notification alerts users to take a picture of whatever they're doing in the moment (back and front camera included). And the next notification resets the pictures from the previous day, meaning that every profile starts with a clean slate. \n\nI've picked up BeReal in January 2022, around the same time I deleted my personal Instagram. With my Facebook essentially a graveyard and Twitter a secluded corner, that left BeReal as my remaining passive communication with old hometown friends \u0026 college homies who I can't see on the daily. It eschews the deceptive design \u0026 sociological patterns intimate to aforementioned popular apps; there's no infinite scroll, nor pressure to accumulate likes or followers. And especially resistant of the creator economy trend, BeReal circumvents the \"influencer\" persona by focusing on first-degree networks. At the same time, I'm hesitant to buy into the fanatic fervor for BeReal, having seen many gimmicky anti-Instagram concepts either sizzle out or turn into their worst enemy to the tune of monetization. \n\n\n\n\nSerendipity \u0026 Evanescence \n\nAuthenticity\n\nContext\n\ntemporal context — time of day \n-everyone at work\n-everyone in lecture\n\n\n\n\n\nthemes: serendipity, authenticity, context, the need to be interesting\n\nrandomness\n\npassing by an ambient tunnel of content","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.093831498Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/tech/career-questions":{"title":"career questions","content":"\n* is working for microsoft in gpus what im truly passionate about? \n* more interested in computational poetry \u0026 poetry in general \n\t* want to work more on design \n\t* contract-based data vis \u0026 design place\n* when would you know you made it?\n\t* is it when i write a chapbook ? \n\t* write a book? \n\t* get tik tok famous?\n\t* make a startup?\n\t* do computational poetry?","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.093831498Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/tech/goodreads-redesign":{"title":"goodreads redesign","content":"\n* problems:\n  * as an avid reader disconnected from my friends its hard for me to maintain digital book clubs\t\n    * scheduling issues\n    * remembering the book we discussed\n  * as a poetry lover its hard for me to find fellow poetry lovers online\n  * im reading too many books at once\n  * difficult to discuss think pieces together\n    * finding ppl interested -\u003e sending them article -\u003e reading it / dissecting it together\n* ideas:\n  * feature to sync up reading amongst devices\n  * accountability tracker (nudge ppl to read)\n  * find other ppl reading same book as u to chat\n  * creating a book club with other people\n  * recommending books based on someone’s book tastes \n  * discovery for new books","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.093831498Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/tech/people-i-aspire-to-be":{"title":"people i aspire to be","content":"\n* https://kayserifserif.place/\n* https://www.spencerchang.me/\n* https://nickm.com/ep2e/\n\t* https://archive.org/details/montfort-exploratory-programming-2e\n* https://stephanieniu.com/\n* https://www.aliciaguo.com/\n* https://twitter.com/aliceyliang\n* https://twitter.com/fieldednotes","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.093831498Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/tech/side-proj-ideas":{"title":"side proj ideas","content":"\n# ideas\n#career\npoetechnics\nhttps://news.mit.edu/2023/poetechnics-podcast-0518\n\n* data visualization of the books I read in 2023\n  * what data did I collect in 2023? \n  * number of flights travelled\n    * 2023 travel report\n    * amount of money spent\n* I want to practice front end dev\n  * using telescopic text on ur website \n* Goodreads redesign [[tech/goodreads redesign|goodreads redesign]]\n  * data of books \n    * scrape good reads data\n    * import books as a cdv \n    * building ur personal library\n* something to collect and compel me to write\n* online hand written notes \n  * online doodles\n* copenhagen bike share / biking lane visualization vs nyc bike share / biking lane\n  * scrolling stories\n  * https://www.donkey.bike/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Evaluation-Donkey-Republic_TUD-20201223.pdf\n  * how do bike shares show how ppl move thru a city \n  * technology \u0026 urban mobility\n* maybe something as simple as a poetry repository\n* comparing coffee shops in diff cities\n  * nyc vs copenhagen vs Shanghai vs Seattle\n  * interactive coffee shop map \n* how do I make something that helps me focus on one passion \n* something to practice scrolling stories\n* something as simple as telescopic text\n* ideas — ai generated stories about inputed Chinese characters (think of that ted Chiang story)\n* generator for all the different paths you could take\n  * react wrapper \n* choose ur own adventure\n  * [Nothing Breaks Like A.I.

i manage, before he cuts me off in english: “which one you want?”\n\ncheeks flushed, i shake my head wordlessly and defer my gaze to the merchandise. i keep myself busy rifling through watches, and take a couple to compare in the the mirror. \n\nwhich one fits better? an ex obsessed with marks of luxury had once dragged me from one watch store to another, pursuing some patek philippe pipe-dream. i tried to rack my brain for what the man from _watches of switzerland_ had said all those years ago -- the watch face should be halfway the size of the wrist? no, a third?\n\na couple of old chinese men pull up — locals, no doubt — and mike of mike’s watches starts bantering with them in _cantonese_. my temporary gall to communicate has escaped me, but i extend my hand and allow him to fasten a watch onto my wrist. it’s a beautiful thing, golden framed bezel and faux diamonds glittering in the store light.\n\ni just need a quick fix, i tell myself as i walk out of the shop with a wrist that glimmers in the sunlight. i don’t need something that lasts.\n\n---\n\ni can recall certain turning points in my life when my perception of time notably shifted. there are certain turning points of life when your perception of time shifts. the numbness in the day after you graduate college. the gossamer stretch just before falling in love. mom says things shift after you have children, with a pointed look at me.\n\nin the break of summer heat, i feel restless. the *dog days*, or so they say. i am disatisfied with my job out of college and feel like i am pacing in one place, watching the days unspool like a piece of thread. i have so much free time that i pack with friend catch-ups, and i go from one cafe to a restaurant to a wine bar to another. the common theme is that i \"gotta be patient,\" as mentors and friends alike try to remind me. \n\ntime is an elusive thing that is constantly escaping my grasp. like some koi fish escaping upstream against water flowing downwards. i’m hasty, as ever, trying to speedwalk my way through chinatown, constantly bumping into traffic jams behind the slow-moving grandmas dragging suitcases across the jagged streets. i am running late to nothing, but i am still impatient. \n\nmy parents pass down advice the way that others pass down fancy watches. my dad loves to remind me that _to be on time is to be late_, while mom needlessly reminds me to slow down.\n\nshe keeps track of my life on a vintage red calendar—the kind you tear off, month by month. each page disappears into the trash. _annie visits home_ in chicken scrawl on the 17th. _pick up jason from airport_.\n\nmy perception of time upturned when i realized how it passes at different rates for my parents, who have calculated the latter portion of their lives around me. there’s this notion that time accelerates as we age, as each year becomes a smaller fraction of our whole life. it’s why childhood feels endless and adulthood feels like a rapid hamster wheel. we’re moving through time at different tempos, and i can feel the gap widening.\n\n[\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xdEb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd39f0352-6177-4dd1-8d64-957187fd28e7_1084x963.jpeg)\n\n\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xdEb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd39f0352-6177-4dd1-8d64-957187fd28e7_1084x963.jpeg)\n\ngraph of our perception of time as we age, inspired by [paul janet’s proportional theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365510382_Paul_Janet_and_Changes_in_the_Apparent_Speed_of_Passage_of_Time_with_Aging)\n\nevery year i do the math: when i’m 30, they’ll be 70. when i’m 35, they’ll be 75. the numbers clarify what matters.\n\n---\n\nnear the new year, chinatown is filled with calendars dictating the year to come. this year is my 本命年, my zodiac year.\n\nit comes every twelve years. chinatown looks the same as it did when i was twelve, as i imagine it to look when i am thirty-six. my last zodiac year, my mom led me through the confusing streets into a jewelry store, where we bought a delicate golden pendant in the shape of a horse. my mom used to work in jewelry stores in upper east side when she first moved here. now she loves to visit jewelry stores, even to browse, as a testament of how far she's come. \n\nshe ties the pendant up on a red string and hooks it around my neck. it's a piece of comfort, and i tend to fiddle with it when i feel nervous. \n\ni wander, looking for a time machine.\n\nthey say gold doesnt tarnish, that gold holds its value. this golden horse unfettered by the test of time. will this fake watch hold its weight in gold?

Waymo’s own safety hub reports **127M rider-only miles (no human driver)** through **September 2025** and publishes city-by-city crash-rate comparisons against human benchmarks, synchronized to NHTSA Standing General Order (SGO) reporting timelines. citeturn32view0\n\nThe same period shows Waymo scaling demand and operations: Waymo’s sustainability page claims **250K+ fully autonomous EV trips per week**, and its 2025 year-in-review post says it served **14M+ trips in 2025 (to date at publication)** and reached **1M+ fully autonomous rides per month** by spring 2025. citeturn33view0turn34view0 Independent reporting from AP similarly describes Waymo as an “early frontrunner” and cites **250,000+ paid rides per week** once Austin/Atlanta rides via Uber are included. citeturn35view2turn35view1\n\nAgainst that baseline, Cruise’s robotaxi trajectory has reversed. After the October 2, 2023 pedestrian-dragging crash and subsequent regulatory and legal actions, GM publicly announced it would **stop funding Cruise’s robotaxi development** and refocus AV development on **personally owned vehicles**; GM later completed full ownership and positioned Cruise as a subsidiary supporting GM’s broader autonomy/ADAS efforts. citeturn28search1turn28search4turn28search3turn28search2 Tesla, meanwhile, continues to characterize Full Self-Driving as **“Supervised”** and its owner documentation repeatedly emphasizes a **fully attentive driver** must remain ready to take over at all times—i.e., it is not marketed by Tesla as a broadly driverless consumer product. citeturn38view2turn22view2turn22view1\n\nThe rest of this report explains how Waymo’s lead emerges from an **integrated technical stack (multi-modal sensing + mapping + simulation + AI)**, a **safety-case posture with unusually public metrics**, and a **commercial strategy oriented around constrained, repeatable operating domains (ODDs)**—and how these choices compare with Cruise, Tesla, and other AV programs.\n\n## Technical innovations and approaches\n\nWaymo’s technical advantage is less about a single breakthrough and more about a **coherent “systems” strategy**: hardware, software, testing, and operations are treated as one product, optimized to safely deliver a high-volume service in defined domains.\n\n### Multi-modal sensing and the sixth-generation Waymo Driver\n\nWaymo’s sixth-generation hardware announcement is explicit about the design intent: **lower cost, higher capability, and broader weather tolerance** without dropping safety-critical redundancy. Waymo describes a 6th-gen sensor suite of **13 cameras, 4 lidars, 6 radars, and external audio receivers**, with overlapping fields of view around the vehicle up to **500 meters**, day/night and across weather conditions. citeturn31view0 Waymo also states it reduced sensor count “while maintaining… redundancies,” and can swap sensing components to better match local conditions (for example, sensor-cleaning adaptations for colder climates). citeturn31view0\n\nWaymo’s public “Waymo Driver” explainer reinforces the company’s long-running view that robust autonomy requires **sensor diversity + fusion + redundancy**: it describes lidar for 3D structure, cameras for 360° visual understanding, radar for distance/speed and robustness in rain/fog/snow, and onboard compute combining server-grade CPUs/GPUs. citeturn12view0 (Waymo also notes legacy platform specifics—e.g., “29 cameras on our Jaguar I‑PACEs”—illustrating how the sensor configuration can vary by platform and generation.) citeturn12view0\n\n**Interpretation:** Waymo’s Gen6 posture is a practical answer to the “robotaxi scaling problem”: even very safe autonomy can fail commercially if the sensor/compute bill of materials can’t economically support a large fleet. Waymo is signaling that its learning curve is now translating into **unit-cost engineering**, not only algorithmic progress. citeturn31view0turn34view0\n\n### AI architecture: Waymo’s “demonstrably safe” foundation-model flywheel\n\nIn late 2025 Waymo published a detailed description of an AI approach centered on a **Waymo Foundation Model** supporting three tightly coupled functions: **Driver**, **Simulator**, and **Critic**—a “virtuous cycle” intended to accelerate learning while keeping safety central. citeturn20view0 Waymo argues this architecture provides benefits “over pure end-to-end or modular approaches” by combining (a) learned embeddings that allow end-to-end backpropagation and (b) “materialized structured representations” (objects, semantics, roadgraph elements) to support verification and physically realistic simulation. citeturn20view0\n\nWaymo also describes a “Think Fast / Think Slow” split: a **Sensor Fusion Encoder** fusing camera/lidar/radar for rapid reactions, and a **Driving VLM** fine-tuned on Waymo driving tasks and trained using **Gemini**, intended to help with rare/novel semantic situations (example: “vehicle on fire”). citeturn20view0 Waymo emphasizes that even with generative ML planning, it uses a **separate onboard validation layer** that verifies trajectories. citeturn20view0\n\nA compact conceptual diagram (derived from Waymo’s description) looks like this:\n\nWaymo AI flywheel concept (Driver–Simulator–Critic), per Waymo’s “Demonstrably Safe AI” description. citeturn20view0\n\n- **Driver** produces candidate behaviors/trajectories (student model for on-car inference).\n- **Simulator** generates closed-loop scenario rollouts at massive scale (distilled models for efficient simulation).\n- **Critic** evaluates logs/sim rollouts, flags edge cases, produces feedback signals and curated datasets (and can support reinforcement learning loops).\n\n**Why this matters competitively:** Waymo is tying together three things competitors often treat separately: (1) autonomy policy learning, (2) synthetic environment generation, and (3) automated evaluation/“critic” tooling. If this integration works as advertised, it can turn real-world driverless operations into compounding returns—Waymo claims “fully autonomous mileage far exceeds manual data” now, and that this data is irreplaceable for capturing real interactions when the system is “fully in charge.” citeturn20view0turn34view0\n\n### Mapping and operational design domains\n\nWaymo’s autonomy story is also a **mapping story**. Waymo says that before operating in a new area, it maps with “incredible detail” (lane markers, signage, curbs, crosswalks), then uses custom maps plus real-time sensor data/AI for localization rather than relying solely on GPS. citeturn12view0 This is a strategic choice: it supports high reliability in defined areas but increases the operational work per city.\n\nCruise’s 2022 safety report reflects a very similar “ODD-first” philosophy: Cruise describes iteratively expanding a limited ODD in San Francisco and using mechanisms like geofences, operational hours, speed limits, roadway-type restrictions, and weather controls to keep driverless operation inside a defined domain; if the AV detects it has exited the ODD, it aims to transition to a minimal-risk condition (MRC). citeturn11view0turn11view2\n\nTesla’s public posture is structurally different: Tesla frames autonomy as a path to a “general solution” built on AI for vision and planning, trained from data at fleet scale. citeturn22view0 Tesla’s Tesla-Vision update explicitly notes its move away from radar and ultrasonic sensors, relying on vision and a “vision-based occupancy network” (used in FSD Supervised) for spatial understanding. citeturn22view1 This suggests Tesla is optimizing for scalability across consumer vehicles and diverse roads, but it also implies **less reliance on high-definition pre-mapping** as a core product constraint (Tesla does not highlight HD mapping in the way Waymo does in its “How it works” explainer). citeturn12view0turn22view0\n\n### Testing and simulation as a product capability, not only a safety step\n\nWaymo’s public materials emphasize breadth of testing modalities. It reports closed-course testing with **40,000+ unique scenarios**, “thousands” of crash-avoidance tests, “more than 20 billion miles in simulation,” and extensive hazard analysis and reliability/durability testing of components. citeturn12view0 In its Gen6 post, Waymo adds that the new sensor suite already has “thousands” of real-world miles and “millions more in simulation,” and argues shared learning across hardware generations reduces the miles needed to train/validate foundation models. citeturn31view0\n\nCruise similarly describes combining supervised on-road testing with “extremely realistic simulations” and deliberately stressing rare scenarios to find edge cases, plus structured integration testing like hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) before broad rollout. citeturn11view1turn10view0\n\nTesla’s AI \u0026 Robotics page highlights large-scale evaluation infrastructure (open/closed-loop, hardware-in-the-loop tooling, simulation producing “highly realistic graphics and other sensor data”) and massive network training (“48 networks,” “70,000 GPU hours,” “1,000 distinct tensors” per timestep), implying a heavy engineering investment in training + evaluation pipelines. citeturn22view0\n\n**Net technical comparison:** All three leaders invest heavily in simulation and evaluation; Waymo’s differentiator is that it couples those investments to **large-scale driverless commercial operations**, creating a tight feedback loop between real service data and structured safety claims. citeturn20view0turn32view0turn34view0\n\n## Testing, safety protocols, and regulatory compliance\n\nWaymo’s lead is inseparable from safety engineering and regulatory survival. Cruise demonstrates how quickly operational momentum can collapse after a safety crisis; Tesla shows how “driver assist at scale” creates a different safety and regulatory conversation than “driverless at scale.”\n\n### Waymo’s safety framework and safety-case posture\n\nWaymo has repeatedly framed safety as a **formal argument** backed by evidence, rather than a vague aspiration. In 2020—when it opened fully autonomous ride-hailing to the public in Phoenix—Waymo published a “Safety Framework” summary describing three major layers: hardware, ADS behavior, and operations. citeturn24view0 That post details methodologies including hazard analysis, scenario-based testing in simulation and closed-courses, and “simulated deployments” to evaluate aggregate performance across many miles and situations. citeturn24view0 It also highlights operational functions like fleet response support, risk management, a field safety program, and governance via a Waymo Safety Board. citeturn24view0\n\nIn 2023, Waymo extended this into an explicit safety-case toolkit, describing a safety case as a formal explanation of how a system is safe enough for driverless deployment and emphasizing credibility of both arguments and evidence, including a “Case Credibility Assessment.” citeturn24view1 This is unusually aligned to how high-assurance industries (aviation, etc.) structure safety. citeturn24view1\n\n### Waymo’s safety performance disclosure: crash-rate benchmarks, miles, and third-party studies\n\nWaymo’s Safety Impact hub is arguably its strongest public-facing differentiator. Waymo states the hub compares rider-only crash rates to human benchmarks for surface streets, claims it uses “publicly available data” so others can replicate results, and says it updates aligned with **NHTSA SGO timelines**. citeturn32view0\n\nKey disclosed metrics (through September 2025) include:\n\n| Rider-only miles by city | RO miles | Share of total RO miles | Visual |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| Phoenix | 56.535M | 44.5% | ████████████████████████████ |\n| San Francisco | 38.816M | 30.5% | ████████████████████ |\n| Los Angeles | 25.47M | 20.0% | ██████████████ |\n| Austin | 6.337M | 5.0% | ███ |\n| **Total** | **127.158M** | **100%** |  |\n\nThese values are taken directly from Waymo’s Safety Impact hub and represent rider-only miles through September 2025. citeturn32view0\n\nWaymo further claims that compared with an average human driver over the same distance in operating cities, the Waymo Driver had **90% fewer serious-injury-or-worse crashes**, **81% fewer injury-causing crashes**, and **82% fewer airbag-deployment crashes**, and also reports large reductions for vulnerable road user (VRU) injury crashes. citeturn32view0 (Waymo provides incidents-per-million-miles tables and confidence intervals, and notes limited mileage can make some city-level comparisons statistically insignificant.) citeturn32view0\n\nIn addition to Waymo’s own dashboarding, Waymo has published and hosted external-facing safety studies. One example is a Swiss Re/Waymo analysis using insurance claims over **25.3M miles**, reporting an **88% reduction in property damage claims** and **92% reduction in bodily injury claims** vs an overall driving population benchmark, and similarly large reductions vs a “latest-generation” vehicle benchmark. citeturn17view1 Waymo’s rider-only safety-performance paper (1M miles) also reports no reported injuries and two CISS-comparable collisions in the first 1M rider-only miles (with methodological caveats about data and benchmarks). citeturn17view0\n\n**Important limitation (and why it still matters):** Multiple third-party observers accept that Waymo’s safety performance appears strong, while also noting comparability issues (e.g., new fleet vehicles vs an older average vehicle population; geofencing; operational constraints). The Atlantic’s 2025 discussion highlights both the “undeniably strong safety record” argument and the methodological critiques. citeturn30view3\n\n### Cruise’s safety case vs Cruise’s safety crisis\n\nCruise’s 2022 Safety Report reads like an attempt at the same safety-case style: it describes ODD enforcement, iterative domain expansion, MRC behavior, redundancy across computers/brakes/sensors/power, and verification/validation pipelines including HIL tests and staged rollouts. citeturn11view0turn11view1turn10view0 It also describes “live operators” supporting driverless AVs and staged operational readiness processes. citeturn10view2turn11view2\n\nBut Cruise’s operational story broke on the October 2, 2023 crash. NHTSA’s recall report describes the sequence: a human-driven vehicle struck a pedestrian, propelling them into Cruise’s path; after an initial stop, the Cruise AV attempted to pull over and dragged the pedestrian forward. citeturn28search3 California DMV’s suspension cited “unreasonable risk to public safety” in revoking Cruise’s driverless deployment and testing permits in 2023. citeturn0search18\n\nRegulatory and legal consequences compounded the technical failure. The U.S. Department of Justice announced Cruise entered a deferred prosecution agreement after admitting to submitting a false record to NHTSA intended to influence the federal investigation of the crash (with a $500,000 fine). citeturn28search2 NHTSA also issued a press release about a consent order addressing Cruise crash reporting. citeturn28search6\n\n**Why this matters for “the race”:** Cruise’s story demonstrates that for robotaxis, “safety” includes not only AV driving behavior, but also compliance, transparency, and institutional credibility. Waymo’s approach—publishing extensive safety methodology and relying on replicable datasets—appears designed to reduce precisely this kind of regulatory fragility. citeturn24view0turn24view1turn32view0\n\n### Tesla’s safety framing: supervised autonomy, telemetry-based collision rates, and regulatory scrutiny\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving is explicitly framed as supervised, both in the name and in the owner manual. Tesla’s Model Y manual states: “Full Self-Driving (Supervised) requires a fully attentive driver… You must remain attentive and be ready to take over at all times while Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged.” citeturn38view2\n\nTesla’s own “FSD (Supervised) Vehicle Safety Report” methodology page defines collision events via federal EDR-style criteria (airbag deployment or delta‑V threshold) and explicitly states Tesla does **not attribute fault** in its collision reporting. citeturn22view2 Tesla also says it counts a collision as “with FSD engaged” if FSD was active at any point within five seconds before the collision event, and that it collects telemetry at massive scale (example: billions of telemetry packages per quarter, excluding China). citeturn22view2\n\nHowever, Tesla’s safety and regulatory narrative remains contentious. For example, The Verge reported in 2025 that NHTSA opened an investigation into delayed crash reporting under the SGO regime (reporting months late), highlighting that Tesla accounts for a large share of SGO-reported crashes and fatalities in the public dataset—though Tesla disputes interpretations and argues SGO datasets are not normalized for exposure. citeturn21news31turn22view2 Separately, NHTSA’s Autopilot investigation has linked Autopilot to fatal crashes and led to recalls and follow-on investigations, as summarized by the Guardian. citeturn21news36\n\n**Bottom line:** Tesla’s approach produces huge real-world data volume and rapid iteration, but (a) Tesla repeatedly emphasizes supervision/driver responsibility, and (b) the regulatory risk profile is very different from a geofenced Level‑4 robotaxi program whose core promise is “no driver required.” citeturn38view2turn32view0turn35view2\n\n## Business strategy and market position\n\nWaymo’s business strategy converts technical capability into defensible market position via (1) gradual expansion, (2) partnerships that reduce “fleet ops burden,” and (3) high-frequency paid rides that create operational learning loops.\n\n### Waymo: scaling a service, not just a technology demo\n\nWaymo’s modern competitive advantage is that it has become a **service operator**, not only an AV developer. Key commercialization milestones include opening Waymo One to everyone in San Francisco (June 25, 2024) and then Los Angeles (November 12, 2024). citeturn25search0turn25search1 Waymo’s Uber partnership expansion (announced September 13, 2024) formalized a playbook for new markets: Uber manages dispatch and fleet-management functions (cleaning/repair/depot ops) while Waymo retains responsibility for the Waymo Driver, roadside assistance, and some rider support. citeturn36view0 Uber’s press materials then announced rider availability in Austin starting March 4, 2025. citeturn25search2turn25search23 By June 2025, AP described Atlanta expansion, noting Waymo+Uber deployed about 100 “completely driverless” vehicles in Austin within months, while Tesla’s then-new Austin robotaxi effort used a human in the passenger seat as a safety monitor. citeturn35view2\n\nAt scale, Waymo’s own reporting suggests the unit economics are still a work in progress, but the operational metrics are large and growing: 250K+ autonomous EV trips per week (Waymo sustainability) and 14M trips in 2025 as of early December 2025 (Waymo year-in-review). citeturn33view0turn34view0 WIRED also emphasizes the capital intensity of this path, noting that since 2020 more than $11B has been committed to Waymo, even amid broader AV industry disenchantment after 2018. citeturn30view0\n\n### Cruise: a strategic retreat resets the competitive set\n\nGM’s own press release makes the strategic turn unambiguous: GM will no longer fund Cruise’s robotaxi development, citing the time/resources needed to scale and an increasingly competitive robotaxi market, and will instead combine Cruise and GM technical teams to advance autonomy and assisted driving for personal vehicles. citeturn28search1turn28search4 This effectively removes Cruise as a near-term robotaxi-scale competitor, regardless of the underlying technical talent and assets Cruise developed. citeturn28search1turn28search4\n\n### Tesla: a software- and subscription-oriented autonomy strategy\n\nTesla’s autonomy strategy is tightly linked to its consumer fleet. Tesla’s AI page frames its approach as AI for vision and planning + efficient inference hardware to reach a “general solution.” citeturn22view0 In early January 2026, multiple outlets reported Tesla would stop offering FSD as a one-time purchase and move to subscription-only (from February 14, 2026), reinforcing the view that Tesla is monetizing autonomy as a recurring software product while pursuing robotaxi ambitions. citeturn27news36turn27news38\n\nBut robotaxi operations are a different business than selling a driver-assist feature. WIRED’s reporting stresses that running a robotaxi fleet requires charging, cleaning, maintenance depots, regulatory engagement, and operational readiness—areas where Waymo has years of hard-won experience and partnerships (e.g., with Uber) designed to split responsibilities rather than “do everything alone.” citeturn30view1turn36view0\n\n### Other notable competitors: Zoox, Mobileye, and Aurora\n\nZoox (Amazon-owned) is building a vertically integrated, purpose-built robotaxi and emphasizes “safe-by-design” plus “safe-in-operation,” publishing safety reports and describing operational safety practices and remote operations responsibilities. citeturn26view0turn26view1 Mobileye (Intel spinoff) differentiates itself by emphasizing a formal safety model—Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)—as a technology-neutral mathematical framework for “what it means to drive safely.” citeturn26view4 Aurora focuses on self-driving freight and publishes a Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment intended to fulfill DOT/NHTSA guidance while explaining how it aims to build safe self-driving. citeturn26view2\n\n**Competitive implication:** while these programs can be strong technically, Waymo’s distinctive edge today is that it is already converting capability into high-volume paid rides, which in turn feeds a learning and validation loop. citeturn34view0turn20view0turn35view2\n\n## Historical evolution and key milestones\n\nWaymo’s lead is partly a **time-in-market advantage**: it began earlier than most rivals and stayed committed through industry hype cycles and disillusionment.\n\n### Milestone timeline\n\nKey milestones from primary/official sources:\n\n- **2009:** Waymo traces its origin to the Google Self-Driving Car Project (Waymo later references beginning in 2009). citeturn24view0turn23view0  \n- **Oct 9, 2010:** Google publicly described its self-driving cars and said they had logged **140,000+ miles** (with trained operators), emphasizing robotics research progress. citeturn18search0  \n- **May 27, 2014:** Alphabet/Google wrote about building self-driving prototypes designed to operate without steering wheel/pedals, to learn quickly from real-world use. citeturn18search3  \n- **Oct 20, 2015:** Waymo later reported it completed what it called the “world’s first fully-self driven car ride.” citeturn18search1  \n- **Dec 13, 2016:** Google’s self-driving project became Waymo, framed as “what’s next” for commercialization. citeturn18search1turn18search7  \n- **Dec 2018:** Waymo launched Waymo One, positioning it as a commercial self-driving service, with careful rollout. citeturn18search2  \n- **Oct 8, 2020:** Waymo opened its fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the general public in Phoenix and published its safety framework around that milestone. citeturn24view0  \n- **Jun 25, 2024:** Waymo One opened to everyone in San Francisco. citeturn25search0  \n- **Nov 12, 2024:** Waymo One opened to all in Los Angeles. citeturn25search1  \n- **Aug 19, 2024:** Waymo announced Gen6 hardware (cost reduction + sensor suite specifics + weather improvements). citeturn31view0  \n- **Sep 13, 2024 → 2025:** Waymo expanded its Uber partnership toward Austin/Atlanta service, splitting fleet ops vs driver operation responsibilities. citeturn36view0turn35view1turn35view2  \n- **Dec 2025:** Waymo reported 14M+ trips in 2025 and framed scaling as “demonstrably safe AI” at service scale. citeturn34view0turn20view0  \n\nA compact “timeline chart” (textual) showing the arc from research to scaled operations:\n\n| Era | Primary emphasis | Representative milestones |\n|---|---|---|\n| Research prototype | sensors + autonomy R\u0026D | 2010 Google disclosure;

it highlights Waymo’s model of installing tech on partner vehicles and partnering (e.g., Uber) so that a single entity doesn’t carry the full operations burden. citeturn30view1turn36view0\n\nNotably, WIRED also reports that Tesla had not meaningfully engaged certain California regulators about robotaxi permitting and did not report autonomous miles to California DMV in a recent year, contrasting with Waymo/Zoox/Cruise’s reporting. citeturn30view1 (This underscores the point that robotaxis scale as much through regulatory process as through neural nets.)\n\n### The Atlantic: “move slow and deliberate” as an AI safety lesson—and the edge-case reality\n\nThe Atlantic’s October 2025 piece argues Waymo is unusually careful for Silicon Valley, noting that compared with competitors, Waymo “moved the slowest and the most deliberately,” and that experts see a strong safety record even while quibbling with how comparisons are made. citeturn30view3 It also highlights a key strategic limitation: Waymo remains geographically constrained to zones within a handful of cities and is cautious with highways, reflecting a deliberate approach to domain expansion. citeturn30view3turn34view0\n\nAt the same time, The Atlantic’s December 2025 blackout story demonstrates how a different class of risk emerges at scale: infrastructure failures (traffic signals down, connectivity issues) can trigger “fleet-level weirdness,” require service suspensions, and stress remote assistance systems. citeturn30view2 This kind of event is not well captured by aggregate crash-rate dashboards, yet it can shape public trust and regulatory appetite. citeturn30view2turn32view0\n\n### WSJ and Forbes: economic realism and “Waymo vs Tesla” debates\n\nDirect full-text access to some WSJ and Forbes articles is restricted in this research session, but snippets and headlines reflect two recurring themes:\n\n- WSJ coverage has emphasized that Waymo “pulled ahead” in robotaxis and is “pulling away,” implying execution advantages beyond mere city expansions. citeturn19search0  \n- A separate WSJ item notes analyst skepticism about the time to payback on robotaxi invested capital (multi-year horizons), highlighting that even a technical leader can face a long march to profitability. citeturn19search4  \n- Forbes has hosted detailed “Waymo vs Tesla” debates (not fully accessible here), reflecting the industry split between a geofenced, sensor-rich robotaxi approach and a camera-based, consumer-fleet approach. citeturn19search1turn19search9  \n\n### What these perspectives add\n\nAcross outlets, the external consensus is not that Waymo has solved autonomy everywhere;

That sense of play, in adulthood, is infused with shame – nobody wants to be as vulnerable and helpless as a child. They want the joy of childhood but not the vulnerability, neediness, or lack of control. So play, via shame, becomes fantasy, which we are inclined to protect and keep hidden, perhaps out of fear of being taken advantage of or ridiculed. The daydream is a more palatable version of the fantasy. The daydream, like a work of fiction, stitches time together: it provides a scenario in which a current desire – motivated by a past desire – creates space for wish fulfilment. You keep living, or keep reading, to find out whether the desire does or does not get fulfilled in the future. You have to be invested in life, or the story, enough to see whether the wish comes true.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.094831508Z","tags":null},"/my-vault/zine-ideas":{"title":"zine ideas","content":"\n- honoring my childhood home \n- something chinese-ish, on time, on cycles, on circles","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.095831518Z","tags":null},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.095831518Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go!

Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Then go to Options \u003e Hotkeys and set a hotkey for 'Insert Template' (I recommend `[cmd]+T`). That way, when you create a new note, you can just press the hotkey for a new template and be ready to go!\n\n\u003e 👀 Step 4: [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview%20changes.md)","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.097831538Z","tags":null},"/notes/philosophy":{"title":"Quartz Philosophy","content":"\n\u003e “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming\n\n## Why Quartz?\nHosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.097831538Z","tags":null},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here's exactly how to do that!\n\nNote that both of these steps need to be completed.\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```shell\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.097831538Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2026-02-06T07:08:17.097831538Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
