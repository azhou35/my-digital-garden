We become good friends and we proactively host things (dinner parties/hackathons/goal setting/etc) that are 0-friction for me to attend & host.<ul><li>There are externalities in being close to them (generally being closer to nyc tech community, being around ambitious girlies who can keep me accountable, have ppl who are always down for creative hobbies together)</li></ul></li><li>I am ok with the walk to transportation / get better at citibiking.</li><li>I am ok with the space I occupy in the apartment and satisfied with the cooking situation.</li><li>I enjoy living in East Village. I make use of the coffee shops (co-working, etc) and get to explore more of the neighborhood. It&rsquo;s easier for me to get to a friend&rsquo;s apartment.

The promise of co-events / hanging falls through.</li><li>I move in January and the commute to a train station is painful cuz of weather & deters me from going out of the apartment. I feel further disatisfied.</li><li>I occupy a smaller space (living/common area wise) and that affects my productivity / comfort level as I also always have someone around.

It&rsquo;s comfortable, convenient, spacious. The loneliness aspect I can mitigate with structuring my work day, and perhaps arises from a general frustration with the state of my career & slowness of my work that culminates in a lost sense of purpose.</li><li>I cannot predict my living situation with this new apt. BUT it sounds super cool and without parental judgement / safety net I would be inclined to take it. Historically I do tend to make somewhat irrational decisions for the allure of the best-case scenario (e.g. transferring from CMU -> Cornell, choosing college to early, choosing to full-send PM) &ndash; I generally operate with a regret minimization framework, face the consequences when it doesnt pan out, and eventually get over my living sitch.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#open-questions><h2 id=open-questions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Open Questions</h2></a><ol><li>The main draw for this living situation is the high quality roommates & potential upside of community building I can get. <strong>Am I over-valuing this promise and will it empirically not deliver what i&rsquo;m looking for</strong> (bc I&rsquo;m too busy post work, they&rsquo;re too busy during work, rooming situation breeds personal ire, we realistically just have separate lives that aren&rsquo;t open for integration, having people around is just not a solution for this deeper anxiety i feel)</li><li><strong>How much am I willing to budge in terms of transportation convenience?</strong> Right now I live close to everything (1/2/3, 4/5/6, A/C/E, R/Q). So a lot of my life is escaping FiDi to go to different areas. This would be a different experience, spending more time within my neighborhood and having to really be intentional about the other places I go to.</li><li><strong>Is living with 3 roomies more chaotic than I expect?</strong> The shared area is decent, but given it&rsquo;s shared by 4 people, more cramped than 2-person situations I&rsquo;ve seen. My room is ok, but also a little cramped. As a remote worker I do stay in my apartment 2-3 times a week. I cook probably 5-6 times a week. Is there a grocery store nearby? A gym?<ol><li>Does the living space deter comfortable hangs from actually happening? Should I just try to host more in my own living space?</li></ol></li><li><strong>What is my risk tolerance and is this too big of a risk to jump?</strong> I think I can vouch for the reliability of the girls. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure how I&rsquo;ll feel about the location/commute.</li><li>What can I do to help my due diligence?<ol><li>Grabbing time with Daniela to get to know her better</li><li>Could grab time with Jaclyn</li><li>Sister suggested I sublet for a week and see how it feels to live there</li></ol></li><li><strong>Do I think there will be a good roommate fit AND a better living situation before January?</strong><ol><li>I do have roomie options but I think I would rather live by myself than with a roomie I wont be close with (which is such a privileged thing to say!!) A lot of ppl also live far from places (e.g. Stepho/Taylor live far from train station, etc, Bahar in UES, ppl who live in Brooklyn, etc)</li><li>I don&rsquo;t believe Ill get an offer from ppl who I look up to as much as these two girls BUT i dont know if thats necessary for a rooming situation</li><li>In any case: rejecting this apartment is <strong>not necessarily saying I will be solo until July.</strong> It&rsquo;s just waiting for a living situation that fits better in 1) distance to trains or 2) living space, while accepting I can&rsquo;t guarantee <em>living</em> with someoen i know already / want to live with</li></ol></li><li></li></ol><p>Opinions collected:</p><ul><li>Pro sublet: Nitin/Justin/Mahesh/An (ish)</li><li>Anti sublet: Mom/Sister/Dad</li></ul><hr><p>General notes (aka brain dump)</p><p>The alternatives
