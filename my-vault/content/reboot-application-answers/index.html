Why is each interesting to you? (100-400 words)</strong></p><p>An editor&rsquo;s core responsibility is to produce one &ldquo;piece&rdquo; for Reboot every 3 months, driving it from ideation to execution. That could look like writing a short story, commissioning and editing an essay, recording a podcast, or producing an event. While we&rsquo;ve often focused on essays, we welcome other expressive mediums.

The intent of these short stories is to examine the consequences that AI can have on our interpersonal relationships and social structure, as well as the ethical dilemmas that ensue in their efficiency. I&rsquo;m inspired by humanist sci-fi by the likes of Ken Liu and Ted Chiang (think The Lifecycle of Software Objects), but at a cadence to match the breakneck speed of AI innovation today.</li></ol></li><li>Mimetic desire, algorithmic taste, and how it manifests in our city design.<ol><li>Analyze the layer of social curation apps intended to help consumers choose their next restaurant/activity/thing to do<ol><li>Case study: Yelp & Chinese restaurants</li><li>Case study:</li></ol></li><li>Introduce the concept of mimetic desire (we want what other people want)<ol><li>How does this impact the way that restaurants position themselves?

<a href=https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/08/1044732/metaverse-history-snow-crash/ rel=noopener>metaverse</a> to humanoid robots—is the form of critical technology writing with the greatest impact on tech development to date. First, it’s the form that technologists actually seem to read. The allure is in the entertainment, but also in the premise that technological innovation can transform the world. Yet good sci-fi doesn’t reproduce mere techno-determinism. Instead, it acts as a 
<a href=https://joinreboot.org/p/paracosm rel=noopener>paracosm</a> through which we can unravel the connections between new technologies and our values, relationships, and politics.

I believe that science fiction is not just a genre but a critical tool for envisioning and critiquing potential futures. For instance, sci-fi has historically shaped concepts like the metaverse and humanoid robots, revealing how these ideas resonate with our values and societal structures. I am particularly interested in how sci-fi can serve as a &ldquo;paracosm,&rdquo; a space where we can explore and critique the implications of new technologies on our lives and relationships. This thematic focus will allow me to leverage my passion for both technology and creative writing to contribute novel perspectives to Reboot.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Metaphors in Language Models and AI Creativity</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Theme:</strong> Investigating how metaphors shape our understanding of artificial intelligence and its creative capabilities.</li><li><strong>Expertise:</strong> With a strong background in linguistics and an enthusiasm for exploring the intersection of language and technology, I am keen to examine how metaphors influence our perception of AI’s potential, particularly in creative domains like poetry. My work in data visualization and communication strategies complements this interest, enabling me to dissect and present how metaphorical language can both reflect and shape the development of AI technologies. This exploration could include examining whether AI can produce meaningful poetry and how these creative outputs challenge or reinforce our ideas about machine intelligence.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>What are 2 headlines for pieces or events you could see yourself producing?</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>&ldquo;The Future in Fiction: How Sci-Fi Shapes Tomorrow’s Technologies&rdquo;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Why Interesting:</strong> This piece would delve into how science fiction not only predicts technological advancements but also actively influences their development.
