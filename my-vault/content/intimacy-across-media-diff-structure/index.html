and in this dynamic, is it really better that the letter was written by theodore the human, as opposed to sam the machine?</p><p>we can extend this same question to our reality. plenty of influencers&rsquo; books are ghost-written. i helped a friend write their break-up text over snapchat in 9th grade, bitmoji waiting and all. even the innocuous millennial-humored greeting card is a ventriloquist sleight of hand to speak through another&rsquo;s words. we&rsquo;ve long used pre-written sentiments as a scaffolding for our own emotions - ai is just another attempt to communicate what we&rsquo;ve hidden away in our heart.</p><a href=#the-courage-to-connect><h3 id=the-courage-to-connect><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>the courage to connect</h3></a><p>all these times i&rsquo;ve been talking about intimacy, maybe what i really mean to say is vulnerability. intimacy is scalable, intimacy can be commoditized, intimacy can be replicated. but vulnerability is nothing without risk - to be vulnerable is to trust that the other party will keep your words and emotions safe, because there are stakes and <em>you have something to lose.</em> without vulnerability, there&rsquo;s no true intimacy.</p><p>this tension between digital and physical connection hinges on what jeremy hadfield calls &lsquo;fundamental asymmetry.&rsquo; the relationship between ai and humans is fundamentally asymmetric. the llm isn&rsquo;t vulnerable like humans; it has nothing to lose. human-ai relationships involve an embodied, free, conscious, feeling being meeting a sophisticated but ultimately empty pattern manipulation.</p><p>this asymmetry reveals why vulnerability is so essential to authentic connection. in human relationships, both parties risk emotional harm - each person exposes their imperfections, fears, and deepest needs to another who could reject or misuse them. the handwritten letter is a perfect instance of vulnerability: messy handwriting and crossed-out words convey a willingness to be seen fully, flaws and all. there&rsquo;s no edit button, no auto-complete, no perfect way to optimize the message.</p><p>the emotional climax of &ldquo;her&rdquo; is when theodore learns that his relationship with sam is not one-to-one; it&rsquo;s many-to-one, her intimacy scaled across many fellow theodore characters who are rubbing their wounds with digital connection. theodore is shocked and feels hurt because he let himself get vulnerable - but the stakes were not matched by sam.</p><a href=#quantifying-the-unquantifiable><h3 id=quantifying-the-unquantifiable><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>quantifying the unquantifiable</h3></a><p>emotions are inscrutable. but the power of innovation is converting these abstract concepts into numbers, numbers that we can parse, interpret, manipulate. tech companies are making fascinating attempts to quantify them, transforming abstract feelings into data we can explore and understand. we&rsquo;ve evolved from basic sentiment analysis to more nuanced multi-dimensional models that better reflect the complexity of how we feel.</p><p>i&rsquo;ve been experimenting with ai tools that integrate emotional expression into digital communication, specifically through voice as a medium. elevenlabs embeds emotions through prompting, while cartesia uses a simpler tag system. with just a few clicks, i can adjust how emotions color a synthesized voice—it&rsquo;s like having a new interface for expression, one that makes me reflect on how we naturally convey feelings.</p><p>voice ai labs like elevenlabs embeds emotions explicitly in the script (through their documentation on &ldquo;prompting&rdquo;), whereas cartesia encodes it through a simple tag assignment. with a click of a button it feels like acting expressed via user interface - how can we modulate our tones and emphasize certain words to convey different emotional colors?</p><p>companies like hume ai are pioneering frameworks with up to 20 distinct emotional dimensions, mapping the intricate gradations between feelings across cultures and contexts. these systems don&rsquo;t replace human emotion but enhance our understanding of it, pointing toward a future where technology doesn&rsquo;t just mimic our emotional capabilities but helps us explore them more deeply.</p><p>what happens when we convert the ineffable to the measurable? there&rsquo;s value in how inmeasurable emotions can be, how in the face of heartache and pain you cannot prescribe the right answer - rather, you <em>grope your way towards an answer.</em> but as these tools evolve, they&rsquo;re not just digitizing emotion—they&rsquo;re expanding the vocabulary of human connection.</p><p>funny thing about my handwriting - it&rsquo;s quite illegible. i&rsquo;m all about making my letters as small as possible. what&rsquo;s the point of writing something down that can&rsquo;t be read clearly? yet this contradiction captures something essential about human connection.</p><p>humans are messy, they&rsquo;re illogical, they do silly things like write notes with their left hand with wet ink that will get smudged anyways, write notes to flames that will flare out. but at the end of the day - was it really about the words in the letter? words that a greeting card or a &ldquo;theodore&rdquo; could mimic? or is it more about the intention to sit down and channel all your energy into writing a note for a friend, concentrate on what makes them special, scrape your brain for what you could say?</p><p>the more sophisticated our tools for connection become, the more desperately we seem to crave evidence of human effort. the kids are back to digital film cameras, scrapbook clubs, bingo boards and post cards. that&rsquo;s the best thing about technological progress - though skeptics can see it as a way of replacing humans, i see it as a forcing function for us to focus on what is the human-ness of it all.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by anniez using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2026</p><ul><li><a href=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/azhou35>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/azhou35>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
