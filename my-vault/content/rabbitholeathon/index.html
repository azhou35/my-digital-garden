The way a city is designed can vary greatly from the way it&rsquo;s used. Dead space between buildings is used for plazas that perhaps no one uses. Neighborhoods that on paper have all the elements for a good public space - proximity to business centers, space, lighting - end up being unused.
Case study in how we battled for congestion pricing in the U.S., examples of removing the bus fee in Boston, how Tokyo utilizes every inch of land, the housing theory of everything and how housing shortages affect other macro-economic outcomes like climate change, obesity, falling fertility rates,
<em>The Death of Great American Cities</em>, <em>Cities for People</em>, <em>A Pattern Language</em>, <em>The Walkable City</em></p><blockquote><p>I’m fascinated by the mismatch between how cities are <em>designed on paper</em> and how they’re actually used. Some neighborhoods have every ingredient for a “good” public space — lighting, benches, businesses nearby — but remain eerily empty. Why? What makes a space feel inviting, safe, or worthy of lingering? I’ve gone down rabbitholes on the psychology of plazas, “desire paths,” and urban dead zones. I love comparing places like Bryant Park (which thrives) vs nearby “leftover” spaces that no one touches, even though they’re technically accessible.

Cities are for people and how do the things we develop incentivize this? For example, policy changes in NYC materially affect one&rsquo;s everyday - congestion pricing has improved one&rsquo;s daily commute through Lower East side. The gendered experience of urban design is surprisingly under-researched, such as how certain patterns in their routine leave them susceptible to unsafe situations at night. Or how Copenhagen became so bikable, through environmental incentives, reclaiming car lanes for cyclists, and reversed

Words are reflections of a human thought, and a language in sum can hold a mirror to a culture&rsquo;s values, biases, and geo-political development. Any word is an inherent rabbit-hole - for example, the origin of <em>tea</em> - whether &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; &ldquo;cha,&rdquo; or &ldquo;chai&rdquo; — reflects which trade route the good tea spread from China: “te” words traveled by sea, “cha” by land, and “chai” evolved through Central Asia.
Or, how in Mandarin, emotional states are expressed through physical metaphors, like &ldquo;angry&rdquo; (生气, shēngqì) translates to &ldquo;generating air.&rdquo; They reflect classic Chinese philosophy like Daosim and Confucianism, and manifests in why Traditional Chinese Medicine incorporates acupuncture and the like.</p><p>Our how in Mandarin, how many of our terms describing emotional state of being are rooted in physical symptoms (e.g. saying happy is the same as opening your heart!)

Supercomputers have an exceedingly simple definition: a computer that can handle high level of performance. But their impacts and implications are grand - historically powering weather simulation and complex physics equations, they&rsquo;re the engine powering large-scale AI training. There&rsquo;s some key dimensions I wish to explore that deserve a compelling narrative: the localized effects of datacenters on the communities they disrupt, with NOVA as a case study; how to sustain a convoluted supply chain amidst a delicate geo-political situation; how power and control of these behemoth computers flowed from government to universities to the hyperscalers.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to take a socio-historical lens to supercomputing, in a fashion inspired by <em>The Idea Factory</em> and <em>The Power Broker</em>. There are case studies and questions galore - who are the main villains and heroes of the industry, how can we align incentives for public good when these systems are owned by private companies, and oh my god, are we gonna run out of power?</p><p>Looking forward, I want to investigate - what is the datacenter 2.0? Will it shift from rural to urban for hyper-localized centers? When attention shifts from training to inference, how will this disrupt these existing infrastructure investments?</p><p>I want to explore supercomputing
News of AI compute has gripped the news cycle - but I&rsquo;m deeply curious on a socio-historical lens on the history of supercomputing, pre-dating its use case for lage-scale training.</p><p>An example case study is examining the new data center, and how it can be built from first-principles given market, geo-political, and environmental pressures.
