The downtown restaurant Mắm, which opened a couple years ago after a period as an itinerant pop-up, is one of my favorite warm-weather spots. Outside the tiny storefront, the sidewalk (and often a fair bit of the street) is crowded with diners perched on low plastic stools set around low plastic tables, gustily eating some of the best, most electrifying Vietnamese food in the city. As the weather become colder and wetter, I’ve become enamored of Lai Rai, a few doors down, operated by the Mắm team (in collaboration with the Greenpoint restaurant Đi Ăn Đi). Where Mắm is scrappy and exuberant, Lai Rai is quiet, self-contained, thoughtfully composed—it’s more a wine bar than a full restaurant, with a deep list of natural-production bottles, and a short, tight list of Vietnamese-inflected bar snacks. One of the loveliest moments of my year was spent gossiping with a friend at the marble bar, each of us sipping something minerally and white, pausing to eat slivers of an enormous surf clam, just barely cooked and chewy-tender, served in its shell under a creamy coconut broth drizzled with a bright-green oil made from shiso, basil, and spicy-floral rice paddy herb. The dish is subtle, gentle, and electrifying, all in one.</p><p>It&rsquo;s really fun because people come in and say that feels nostalgic if they lived in Vietnam during that time, or visited Vietnam during then. But everything that we do - the music and the visuals and the food and the wine - we just want to give our guests a snippet into Vietnamese culture in Vietnam or bring it here to New York.</p><p>imagine you transported into a parisian wine bar.

But it&rsquo;s the sound that&rsquo;ll catch your attention: lilting notes of Vietnamese new wave music in the background, glasses clinking, and spoons hitting against metal cups. and visuals of movies from Tran Anh Hung are an homage to the owner&rsquo;s Vietnamese culture.</p><p>Lai Rai opened in fall 2024 as a collaboration between Jerald Head and his former bosses Kim Hoang and Tuan Bui from Greenpoint&rsquo;s Di An Di.</p><p>&ldquo;My wife picked the name,&rdquo; Jerald explains. &ldquo;I think the literal translation is &rsquo;little by little,&rsquo; which is a great example of the day-by-day mentality of not getting too far ahead or having expectations. But it also has an expression of being like a little bit of food or a little bit of drink, snacks here and there with some drinks here and there.&rdquo;</p><p>The origin story of Lai Rai is refreshingly practical. Jerald opened the hot Vietnamese spot Mắm in 2023, but couldn&rsquo;t get a liquor license because of its proximity to a local school. With vacant real estate on the block, the opportunity to create something new presented itself.</p><p>&ldquo;It seemed like a not too complicated project, one that we both enjoy: natural wine,&rdquo; Jerald says of the decision to open Lai Rai. With 17 years in the restaurant industry and a deep appreciation for Vietnamese cuisine, Jerald carved a quaint spot over on Forsyth street.</p><p>A love for natural wine &ldquo;skyrocketed&rdquo; through his travels through Europe. But the spark Lai Rai&rsquo;s distinctive concept of pairing wine with artisanal ice cream was found in Paris at <em>Folderol,</em> a spot that left Jerald &ldquo;blown away by the pairing.&rdquo;</p><p>While the Parisian inspiration offered conventional flavors like chocolate and Concord Grape, Lai Rai took the concept in a decidedly Vietnamese direction.</p><p>&ldquo;If we were going to be a Vietnamese wine bar, it&rsquo;s very important that we&rsquo;re serving Vietnamese flavors,&rdquo; Jerald notes. &ldquo;Using Vietnamese flavors that can sometimes tend to be savory—as you could imagine, Southeast Asian maybe doesn&rsquo;t enjoy their sweets too sweet. So it made it very easy to do earthy tones that pair well with the wine.&rdquo;</p><p>The result is a menu of ice creams that might surprise the uninitiated: fish sauce caramel, Laughing Cow cheese, avocado, banana leaf, and chrysanthemum, among others. Each flavor is crafted to balance sweetness with savory notes, creating perfect companions to natural wines.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always seen ice cream as kind of like that blank canvas to explore and be adventurous with,&rdquo; Jerald says. The approach seems to be working—guests who might initially hesitate at flavors like fish sauce caramel typically leave as converts.</p><p>Joyce, who works closely with guests at Lai Rai, observes, &ldquo;Once they do try it, they&rsquo;re super in love with it. Our fish sauce caramel has a perfect balance of sweet and savory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s original, and it is definitely uplifting for their community in Vietnam, employing indigenous folk, and really changing their lives and giving them even some type of royalty for whatever product they may forge for their wines,&rdquo; Jerald explains of Som Gai&rsquo;s practices.</p><p>Their sparkling rice wine, made with purple sticky rice, is a standout offering that might surprise even seasoned wine enthusiasts. &ldquo;The fermentation happens naturally in the bottle, which is very, very beautiful,&rdquo; Jerald describes. &ldquo;It has that color and taste almost like a grape or berry wine. It has those berry notes, and because of the purple sticky rice, it just has a beautiful color to it.&rdquo;</p><p>The wine list also features other Asian producers, including Hana Makgeolli, a Brooklyn-based Korean rice wine producer, and Akishika Shuzo, a Japanese sake brewer practicing biodynamic farming.</p><p>inspired by Hanoian and Indochine architecture ==a style born from French colonial influence in Southeast Asia==, blends

The carefully curated soundtrack features Vietnamese artists spanning from the 1960s to the present, covering genres from traditional Bolero (Nhạc Vàng) to contemporary electronic music.</p><p>&ldquo;Music is just another way for us to share this other aspect of Vietnamese culture that might not be very well known to most people,&rdquo; Joyce explains. &ldquo;Vietnamese culture has such a long and rich musical history that a lot of people might not know about.&rdquo;</p><p>The visual projection wall showcases films by celebrated Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung, music videos from Vietnam&rsquo;s vibrant pop culture, and homemade video tours through cities like Saigon, Hanoi, and Huế. These elements create a nostalgia for Vietnamese visitors and an immersive introduction for others.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything that we do—the music and the visuals and the food and the wine—we just want to give our guests a snippet into Vietnamese culture in Vietnam or bring it here to New York,&rdquo; Joyce says.</p><p>Indo-French achitecture, streetside cafes.

They work with Som Gai</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s original, and it is definitely uplifting for their community in Vietnam, employing indigenous folk, and really changing their lives and giving them even some type of royalty for whatever product they may forge for their wines.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Another way Lai Raiviet wine: Daniel and Yume and I are very like-minded, and I&rsquo;m just constantly wondering what they&rsquo;re working on, visiting their laboratory and just kind of seeing what they&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s been very inspiring. I learned so much from them.</p><p><strong>community</strong>
Lai Rai has organically developed a community hub, hosting special events like graduations and weddings.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had people celebrate weddings here, graduations, just lots of moments to celebrate life and community here at Lai Rai, which we always love to be a part of.&rdquo;</p><p>Lai Rai opened in 2024 fall, as a mutual effort between Jerald Head and his former bosses <strong>Kim Hoang and Tuan Bui</strong> from Di An Di.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;I mean, the food industry, it kind of comes organically as, you know, if you&rsquo;re around it, exposed to it. I would say if both skyrocketed for both of us through our travels through Europe, for sure. It&rsquo;s natural wine is everywhere.&rdquo;
Along with a well-curated wine list, they

She then went on to discuss the types of music they play rather than naming specific favorite songs. She mentioned that they play music from Vietnamese artists spanning from the 1960s to the present, covering genres like Vietnamese new wave, Bolero (Nhạc Vàng), surf rock, folk music, punk, hip-hop, house, techno, and experimental electronic music.</li></ol><p>She also mentioned they project videos from Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung and play music videos from artists like &ldquo;Nhóc Lăng&rdquo; and clips from &ldquo;Paris by Night&rdquo; (a Vietnamese musical variety show), but didn&rsquo;t specify particular favorite songs.</p><p>Have you ever</p><p>We play snippets from this Vietnamese director we really love, Tran Anh Hung, who has directed movies like &ldquo;The Scent of Green Papaya,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cyclo.&rdquo; We project them onto the walls, we play music videos by Vietnamese artists that we really love, specifically from Paris by Night, which is a Vietnamese musical variety show. We play clips from music videos of artists like Ngọc Lan, really fun artists who have fun music videos with a very retro style from like the 80s or 90s. We also played clips of homemade video tours through different cities in Vietnam, like Saigon and Hanoi and Huế. It gives people snippets of what Vietnam looks like during that time, during that era of the 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s.
