culinary class wars is a korean spin on the classic cooking shows where two groups of chefs are pitted against each other: &ldquo;white spoons,&rdquo; representing the elite, and &ldquo;black spoons,&rdquo; the lesser-known chefs from humble backgrounds. spoon coming from the korean term, &ldquo;born with a silver spoon in your mouth,&rdquo; to indicate someone with a privileged life. they engage in cooking challenges and their social class distinction is emphasized throughout, highlighting the clash between culinary pedigree and untapped talent.</p><p><em>“Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es”</em>
<em>“Tell me what you eat and I will tell you who you are”</em></p><p>there&rsquo;s only two judges - a departure from the typical three - with dramatically different judging styles. paik jong-won represents the working class and favors what is universally delicious; anh sung-jae hails from a three-michelin star restaurant and has an acute sense of detail. despite the latter&rsquo;s background, he still passes humble dishes like bibimbap and school lunches</p><p>To discern is not to distinguish the difference between good and bad, it is the difference between good versus great.</p><a href=#frameworks-for-taste><h3 id=frameworks-for-taste><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>frameworks for taste</h3></a><p>the first thing people ask for in the city, outside of your instagram, is for your beli. if instagram is a projection of everything you want people to think you are, beli lends credibility to the arbiters of good taste.</p><p>therein lies a paradox when it comes to ranking systems - taste is subjective, yet there are some universally accepted rankings on what is considered good or not. arguments about your top 10 restaurants can go no where because we default to the argument that <em>taste is subjective.</em> according to hume, this default response isn&rsquo;t satisfying. he regards the natural capacity of taste as fundamental_ to the human ability to make moral and aesthetic judgments."</p><p>hume purports a framework: &ldquo;Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character.&rdquo; common pitfalls for taste-makers are to index on:</p><ol><li>nostalgia<ol><li>ofc you will prioritize songs that are nostalgic to you</li></ol></li><li>falsified novelty
2. reserve judgement that its musically better just bc its &ldquo;better&rdquo;</li><li>complexity
in other words, you need to cultivate the following traits</li><li>eye for detail</li><li>practice</li><li>comparison to other art</li><li>you need a strong sense - strong presence
on the sensitivity, every product designer&rsquo;s favorite documentary <em>jiro dreams of sushi</em> says - > “In order to make delicious food, you must eat delicious food. The quality of ingredients is important, but you need to develop a palate capable of discerning good and bad. Without good taste, you can&rsquo;t make good food. If your sense of taste is lower than that of the customers, how will you impress them?</li></ol><blockquote><p>When I think of someone with a highly acute sense of taste and smell, the first person I think of is the great French chef Joel Robuchon. I wish I were as sensitive as he. I have a very good sense of smell, but he&rsquo;s on another level. His sensitivity is very high. If I had his tongue and nose, I could probably make even better food.”</p></blockquote><p>there&rsquo;s a reason there&rsquo;s a difference between a nytime food critic and a foodie influencer, a literary critic vs a goodreads author. sure, the former comes off as pretentious, audacious, nitpicky - but they&rsquo;re backed by a strong fundamental framework for all their decisions.</p><p>im less criticalabout the outcome, more about the framework w which you review the food. i will not claim to be n expert gastronome but im very interested in the context in which a food is prepared</p><a href=#fusion><h3 id=fusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>fusion</h3></a><p>in the second episode a particular exchange between anh and a young chef from la stood out. the chef endears to anh&rsquo;s korean-american background with galbi garnished with guacamole, waxing poetry on how it reflects his internal identity in the kitchen. instead of a high grade the chef is immediately cut. anh is brutally honest in his assessment: &ldquo;fusion for the sake of fusion is lazy.&rdquo; fusion without intention, without coherence, comes out of insecurity.</p><p>ouch. in that moment, i felt the chef&rsquo;s bile in my mouth. how many poems and think pieces have i written unpacking my identity? at the same times, how many times have i been burned by some pork-belly-kimchi, kimchi-taco? i entered yingtao, the first chinese restaurant in nyc to earn a michelin star, with high expectations. i entered the hells kitchen with a thesis that chinese cuisine is misrepresented on the fine dining scene and that yingtao, perhaps, had potential to break through.
with a weak french x chinese theme, everything was uninspiring and poorly executed. the sea bass with flowers and goji berries was overcooked.</p><p>there&rsquo;s this greater takeaway here, that when we muddle something we sometimes forget to execute well at this one thing.</p><a href=#taste-as-a-point-of-view><h3 id=taste-as-a-point-of-view><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>taste as a point of view</h3></a><p>art should have a point of view. the things we choose to consume should exemplify a point of view.
i&rsquo;m a firm believer of the bastardazation of the iconic quote: you are what you eat.</p><ul><li>people develop taste within a vacuum<ul><li>what do they want others to think of them</li><li>what do they personally bring them joy
&ldquo;growing shift toward valuing culinary ingenuity and heart over institutional pedigree, something American audiences can relate to as they witness the rise of chefs who don&rsquo;t follow the traditional culinary school-to-Michelin path&rdquo;</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#consume-to-aspire><h3 id=consume-to-aspire><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>consume to aspire</h3></a><p>oily strands of chapagetti adorned with thick cuts of buttery rib eye steak. a statement of class from <em>parasite.</em>
in the end, all korean films go back to class. food is such a reflection of class desires - the lower class idolizes that of the upper class and aims to imitate.
anh enthralls dishes that honor the humble roots of korean cuisine, like fermented kimchi and [ ],
there&rsquo;s even a scene when they raid a convenience store and make fancy dishes out of poor man&rsquo;s food.
we must leapfrog the current trends as by the time you get to replicate it, it&rsquo;s become out of vogue.
piere bourdieu calls it out in Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste" (1979), argues that taste is not natural or innocent - it&rsquo;s a form of social power and class distinction.
dominant classes maintain their position from economic capital as well as defining the standards for &ldquo;good taste.&rdquo; this is why <em>refined taste</em> involves appreciating things that are difficult to understand without culturla capital - natural wine, tasting menus, molecular gastronomy.</p><p>by the time a trend democratizes, the upper class has already moved onto fetishizing something else.</p><a href=#become-who-you-are><h3 id=become-who-you-are><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>become who you are</h3></a><p>i argue that to become who you are, develop your taste within a vacuum. tell me what you taste and why you taste. i will never be critical of someone&rsquo;s taste palette - but over-critical if there&rsquo;s a lack of intention. as anh say, as chefs cook they have to put out a point of view. developing our own taste is a marker of perspective, and to defend and evolve it is akin to our own identity.</p><p>conscious engagement with how we develop our preferences. develop a framework for evaluation that appreciates quality acros class boundaries.</p><p>call for metacognition about taste - being conscious of how our preferences are shaped by social forces while still developing a genuine point of view. It&rsquo;s not about ignoring social context, but rather engaging with it intentionally rather than passively.</p><a href=#digital-diet><h3 id=digital-diet><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>digital diet</h3></a><p>if we consume shit we produce shit.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by anniez using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2026</p><ul><li><a href=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/azhou35>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/azhou35>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
