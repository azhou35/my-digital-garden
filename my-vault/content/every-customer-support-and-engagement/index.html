I spend my days working as a technical product manager on Microsoft&rsquo;s AI Supercomputing team, defining and driving operational excellence for our highest-value customers. In the past I&rsquo;ve worked across technical writing, marketing, and UX design.</p><p>I spend my evenings exploring ideas around creative tools through writing, prototyping, and designing. I’m excited about carving spaces to cultivate creativity and I host <strong>
<a href=https://mseah.com/Creative rel=noopener>regular events</a></strong> to unite the community through writing clubs, photowalks, and cultural events. I think a lot about information representations, human-computer interfaces, embodied cognition, and the nature of thought. **</p><p>Why Me?
I&rsquo;m <strong>customer-obsessed</strong> in all that I do. It&rsquo;s not just a business principle—it&rsquo;s a mindset that drives everything I do, pushing me to deeply understand problems. I&rsquo;ve developed a keen sense for understanding people&rsquo;s needs, spotting friction points, and finding elegant solutions. In a way I see myself as a techno-anthropologist &ndash; looking for patterns in the way people use technology and the way technology shapes our behavioral patterns.</p><p>I believe in <strong>building communities</strong> that transcend platforms. I&rsquo;ve created playgrounds for experimentation where ideas flourish and users feel truly heard. I&rsquo;m naturally responsive and organized—the person friends turn to when they need clear explanations or thoughtful solutions.</p><p><strong>Writing was my first love.</strong> My friends and I built worlds through stories, examining the human experience through creative lenses. Yet somewhere along the way, I discovered that technology offered powerful tools to amplify these passions. I&rsquo;ve found my place at the intersection where humanities provide context and technology drives change &ndash; connecting the dots looking backward, bringing empathy and intention to everything I build.</p><p><strong>Why Every?</strong></p><p><em>#01: Building the Future of Publishing</em><br>In the history of publishing, technological innovations the biggest inflection points. The publication space is dramatically changing &ndash; most journals migrated from paper to online paywalls, and newsletter services like beehiiv and Substack are putting the power of publication back into the public&rsquo;s hands. Yet there remains endless blue sky for reimagining what&rsquo;s possible at the intersection of AI and writing.</p><p>I deeply resonate with Every&rsquo;s vision of the mutually beneficial feedback loop between building and writing—dual ways of imagining new worlds. You write better when you&rsquo;re also building, and build better when you&rsquo;re writing about your process. After years in tech companies where writing is treated as an afterthought, I&rsquo;m drawn to a place that elevates it as a core product—recognizing it as the magical medium that transforms minds, spreads ideas, and imagines new worlds.</p><p>#02: A Product Studio as Creative Playground</p><p>I&rsquo;m constantly exploring new curiosities and believe in quick prototyping with immediate audience feedback. Rapid iteration trumps lengthy planning cycles, and prototyping and documenting abstract ideas in public is the best vehicle for innovation. Every&rsquo;s Product Incubation arm offers exactly this environment—a front-row seat to experimentation where ideas can be tested rapidly and refined through user interaction.</p><p>As someone who loves connecting dots across different domains, I want to lean on my interests in design, behavioral science, data, and technology, and use writing as a catalyst to help my own ideas come to life, as well as empower the ideas of Every&rsquo;s audience.</p><a href=#03-what-im-most-excited-for-at-every><h2 id=03-what-im-most-excited-for-at-every><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>#03: What I&rsquo;m Most Excited For At Every:</h2></a><ul><li><strong>Dogfooding new tools</strong>. I&rsquo;m an indie tools user at heart, and I want to become an savant of Every&rsquo;s product suite and understand their potential from the inside out.</li><li><strong>Creating interactive demos</strong>. I&rsquo;m driven to bridging the gap between technical concepts and non-technical audiences, and building intuitive user experiences is a perfect way to actualize that.</li><li><strong>Driving community engagement.</strong> I&rsquo;m an extrovert and deeply thoughtful of how to unite a tribe based on common passions &ndash; I&rsquo;d love to build upon this experience to foster meaningful connections among Every&rsquo;s audience through meetups and workshops.</li><li><strong>Prototyping experimental features.</strong> If the role allows, would love to work closer with the EIR and see under-the-hood of how new features are ideated and designed, and even try my hand at breathing life into my own ideas.</li></ul><p>For more about me, see anniezhou.online or email

Overall, we’re trying to build an institution in business writing and create a space that’s a creative playground for writers, engineers, designers, entrepreneurs, and other creative people where they can write about things and make them.</p><p>thinking about the next-gen step for substack newsletter writing</p><p>I think you can write better when you’re also building, and you can build better when you’re writing about
What I love about Every’s writing is that it’s treated like a product. Everywhere else, when you write for a tech company, it’s always secondary to the product. But here, the writing <em>is</em> the product. From idea to execution</p><p>Annie&rsquo;s Pitch for Every</p><ul><li>Our position is to prioritize rolling out 61, not to wait for SAT13, and inform them of the potential risk / variability of time window given this is our first time on H100. Theyre not running any important jobs that need to avoid interruption for the next week.</li><li>We&rsquo;re going to ask OAI if we could roll out updates to 61 as early as tomorrow. Need to roll out CRD&rsquo;s impactless VE to pre-stage, and once it&rsquo;s ready we should plan to start updates.</li><li>@IB Switch it does put the EST coast folks in a hard position time-wise since we don&rsquo;t have complete confidence in when the pre-staged VE will be done (yet - Oswaldo is confirming internally w his team). We&rsquo;ll try to push for ASAP, but SCHIE team&rsquo;s constraint is to avoid Thursday to avoid spillover into weekend.</li></ul><p>Why Me?</p><p>I nerd out about products
I&rsquo;m a people person and love driving spaces of creativity for people. In my first year in NYC I&rsquo;ve held bi-weekly writing clubs, photowalks</p><ul><li>Assist startups with launch</li></ul><p>Job:</p><ul><li>PM at Microsoft</li><li>Tech Writing at AWS</li><li>PM Intern at NLP Startup</li></ul><p>-> Deep conviction to try a studio model.

<a href=https://every.to/chain-of-thought/every-s-master-plan rel=noopener>included in the Every subscription.</a></p><p>Incubating products isn’t new to us. Over the last two and a half years we’ve incubated 
<a href=http://spiral.computer/ rel=noopener>Spiral</a>, 
<a href=http://makeitsparkle.co/ rel=noopener>Sparkle</a>, and 
<a href=https://lex.page/ rel=noopener>Lex</a>, which Every cofounder Nathan Baschez spun out into its own company. It’s been without a doubt the most fun period of the company, and it’s paid dividends: We have better ideas and write better articles when we’re building things than when we’re commentating from the sidelines.</p><p>Releasing products also connects us to a long tradition of writers who are builders. Consider the <em>New York Times</em>: It is the newspaper of record and also a digital bundle that includes everything from games to recipes to product reviews. Glossier started as a newsletter, and so did Bridgewater. Basecamp, Hey, Trello, and StackOverflow are all the products of writers who create great software.</p><p>Language models are radically bringing down the cost to produce a prototype of a product. What used to take months or years now takes hours or days. We know this first-hand: The first version of 
<a href=https://spiral.computer/ rel=noopener>Spiral</a> was built in two days. We regularly build apps for internal use in hours or minutes. </p><p>We’ve also spent years building up an audience of readers like you—people who love new technology and new businesses, and who want to try the things we make. For most companies, it is expensive to validate whether anyone wants to use an experimental product. For us, it’s our life’s blood. If you’re building a product inside of a media business, the cost of customer acquisition is negative.</p><p>Some of our most 
<a href=https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-3-is-the-best-journal-you-ve-ever-used rel=noopener>successful articles</a> are based on 
<a href=https://every.to/chain-of-thought/i-trained-a-gpt-3-chatbot-on-every-episode-of-my-favorite-podcast rel=noopener>prototypes</a> that never became full products, but did teach us a lot about what the future might look like. Each experiment informs our perspective so that we can write better articles and reach new readers. </p><p>We think this low cost of experimentation—both to prototype and to reach an audience—is an 
<a href=https://every.to/napkin-math/when-content-creation-goes-to-zero rel=noopener>incredible advantage</a> to finding great new product ideas.</p><ul><li>INTERNAL ONLY - with all the payload owners for the impactful updates.
