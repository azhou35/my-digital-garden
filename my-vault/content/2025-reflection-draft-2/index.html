<img src="/my-digital-garden/Pasted image 20260101160340.png" width=auto>
i take this to mean: the combination of your two inputs - how you meet in conversation - should create something uniquely generative. in statistics, there&rsquo;s the notion of an <em>interaction term</em>. take X and Y, both which affect an outcome - if they are independent, their effect is separate. an interaction term (X × Y) says: the way X affects the outcome depends on Y, i.e. X and Y together produce something new that neither produces alone.</p><p>when i consider my close friends, i think of the qualities they have that i admire. conversations w j teach me how to show up as a good friend, how to be a good host, how to be uber-intentional. s curates a wardrobe of vintage shoes and coats, is ready with camera recs at my beck and call, and helped me bring the vision of a photo gallery to life in june.</p><p>the people i stuck close to were those who shared a common ethos. & sometimes the fabric that ties you together with other people isn&rsquo;t obvious - the ethos can be as simple as <em>I care about this group of people and I will show up, over and over again.</em> intention needs to be <em>sustained</em> - to cook food together, to linger at the doorway after a home-cooked meal. the people who show up to the pre-game and the afters, who come to set up and clean up afterwards.</p><p>as well as being fellow skeptics
- me and v and j love to sit ont the floor and play catan
- if everyone is operating by some specified formula, a successful relationship is one where you recombinate the equations.
- people are all driven by internal incentives and you cant change them
- you can only align yourself with the people on the same wavelength as you
- can&rsquo;t just be achieved by hanging out with &ldquo;cool people&rdquo; who have started companies or built up brands or curate their social medias.
- &ldquo;but it is important to note that curating your milieu isn&rsquo;t only or even primarily about being picky. it is about how you relate to people.&rdquo;
- intimacy is not a proxy for closeness. its ok for friends to pick things over you - career, family, even other friends. there&rsquo;s no post-mortem to a faded friendship.
- but that makes the people who stick by you all the more meaningful. i found that the people i stuck close to were those who shared a common ethos - and sometimes that ethos is as simple as I care about this friend group and I will show up, over and over again. relationships that sustain care.
in other words - it&rsquo;s easy to be universally well-liked, harder to be consistently chosen.

ii. <em>the longer you deny yourself alignment, the less optionality matters</em></p><p>i long understood authenticity as a core life value - it&rsquo;s why i agonize over representing myself well on social platforms designed to flatten its users, it&rsquo;s why i strive to show up in my complete self in all convos. early 2025 i was proud of myself for living a well-balanced life. the only nagging feeling was re: my job - i felt like i was wasting time. previously, i convinced myself i could live a complete 5-9 to offset the ennui in my 9-5.</p><p>a year of muddling through teams and a windows computer, it became clear i couldn&rsquo;t do this forever. a 9-5 is still 40 hours a week. when your work drains you - even in its inactivity - it’s hard to muster energy for anything outside it.</p><p>in 2025 i sought alignment: that is, how do i create a life that is so attuned to my values? alignment is downstream of valuing <em>authenticity</em> - in order to act in accordance with values and desires, it necessitates at continuous negotiation and callibration of my inputs. intuition is a fine-toothed arrow, but a finnicky one at that. it points you towards the work you run towards, even if it means living in uncertainty.</p><p>i get frustrated when people tell me <em>i need to stay in this job at least 2 years</em> - which is prob why i never went into finance / consulting. we&rsquo;re wired to preserve optionality: but a dream deferred is just as bad as a dream wrinkled up.</p><p>trying to find Your Thing is is in tension with preserving optionality. fantasizing about a new job is almost more fun than the actual process. every decision was agony: whether i turned down a company or it rejected me, it felt like a door shutting in my face.</p><p>it&rsquo;s difficult to forecast outcomes. inputs are the only thing under our control: the frameworks and values that guide our daily decision-making. i.e., i can&rsquo;t control whether this substack ever blows up, but i <em>can</em> control following my intellectual curiosity, working hard, and writing regularly.</p><hr><p>we are free to design a life that is best fit for us in all dimensions. designing a life doesn&rsquo;t need to prescribe results, but it demands you choose your inputs and constraints. i want a job that impacts people, demands focus, sits at the edge of technology, and allows me to work both technically and collaboratively. i want a life that is: well-balanced, opening me to new eperiences, involves bringing people together. today, i may not be at the final state, but i&rsquo;m happy to say i&rsquo;m directionally correct.</p><p>in 2026,</p><ul><li>without fundamentals, beauty collapses<ul><li>social media prioritizes <em>trends</em> - if you think your pinterest feeds look alike, its bc they prioritize aesthetics. aesthetics are so easily consumable by the glazed-over viewer</li><li>a decent photo has framing, color, light and shadow.
