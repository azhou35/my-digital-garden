Meanwhile, you also, I think on the same interview, I think it was with Peter Attia, you said, &ldquo;I cold emailed him, which is how most things started in my life.&rdquo; And so my question is, how have curiosity and serendipity played a factor or a guiding role in your life?</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> Wow. Well, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re kinda like the, the two guiding factors, &lsquo;cause curiosity is, for me, the intrinsic motivation to pursue most things actively. And then serendipity is the kinda X-factor that&mldr; I mean, that&rsquo;s e- everything you, you can&rsquo;t control, right? So your life ends up being this combination of things happening to you, which is sort of the serendipity part, and then you doing things that you wanna go do. And, uh, I generally wanna do is whatever I&rsquo;m curious about.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> So I never thought about it that way, but I guess those are kinda the two, the two, uh, weather vanes.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> When did you start cold emailing people? Last y- Are you still doing much of that?</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> Oh, yeah, I still&mldr; I cold email a lot. I probably started cold emailing people in high school.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> And-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Probably a good broad, um, pattern in, like, interesting people is like a high about&mldr; People are always talking about like, &ldquo;Oh, did you sell something in high school?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> But the cold emailing thing is probably a pretty good marker too.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> Yeah, I would do&mldr; I mean, I did a little bit of cold emailing in high school. Then it really took off in college. And when I was trying to get my music career going, that was when I did the most cold emailing-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Mm-hmm</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; probably, because the record business, I think even still, and probably less than it used to be, but it- it- that&rsquo;s, like, historically always been such a gatekeeper industry, where it&rsquo;s like, you know, almost everyone&rsquo;s story involves a, quote, &ldquo;big break&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> And that big break-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; is just essentially someone responding to you, [laughs] you know?</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> So you&rsquo;re&mldr; There- there&rsquo;s really&mldr; That&rsquo;s like the original cold calling-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; game, because you just have to keep cold calling until somebody responds to you, and then when they do, that&rsquo;s your big break.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> So that was definitely how we approached it, which was just, like, cold, you know, send our music to anyone who might be in a position where [laughs] they could open a door for us.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> And then that&rsquo;s been something I&rsquo;ve always done, even since then. And, and, you know, now it&rsquo;s more of like, if I read something that, that was written by someone, where I think I&rsquo;d like to talk to them or&mldr; Now, I also just try to send people emails if, uh, I really like what they&rsquo;re doing in the world, as- particularly even if there&rsquo;s, like, no agenda. Like, you know, if I don&rsquo;t wanna&mldr; I&mldr; You know, if&mldr; &lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m such a fan of people [laughs] that I&rsquo;ll reach out to them just to say like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fan of what you&rsquo;re doing-&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Hmm</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; &ldquo;but I know there&rsquo;s nothing in it for me.&rdquo; Like, I&mldr; You know, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no reason for you to spend time with me. There&rsquo;s really no practical reason for me to spend time with you, but I just want you to know, like, what you&rsquo;re doing is great and-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Yeah, but you&rsquo;re also spinning the serendipity wheel there a little bit, right?</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> Yeah, you never know. You never know what&rsquo;s gonna happen. And I will say, also, you know, there are some people who, like, this guy, Virgil Abloh, who was the designer at Louis Vuitton, I never met him in person. Or, maybe I met him once. I- I don&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t have a relationship with him, but I think&mldr; I don&rsquo;t know if he was just like this or if it was just once he got cancer that he started doing this, but, like, I got&mldr; He, he sent me a message at one point-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Mm-hmm</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; that was just a really sweet note about having loved my music. And it made my da- I mean, it was just&mldr; It was so sweet. Like, you know what I mean? And I didn&rsquo;t know him, but I obviously knew who he was and I knew how important he was. So that kinda motivated me to then do that more-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Mm-hmm</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; because I realized, you know&mldr; You&mldr; I&rsquo;m not saying this about myself, but it&rsquo;s like you&mldr; Even people who have gotten a lot of, lotta love from the world, a lot of them still, you know, have self-doubt, or they don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re good, or they don&rsquo;t think that their work is good. And you, you just never know if you telling them that they&rsquo;re special or that their thing is great is gonna make the difference.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> So-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> I like that a lot</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; I now, I now try to do that a little.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> I think the other cool thing is there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a little bit more of a consensus, at least maybe in technology circles or ambitious people circles, that when you&rsquo;re young, cold emailing is a really good thing to do. And I&rsquo;ve always admired people who have a little more credibility or success behind them and still have that&mldr; &lsquo;Cause, maybe to go back to the beginning of it, it&rsquo;s&mldr; It feels like it&rsquo;s rooted in some kind of authentic curiosity more than unlocking some door or something like that.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> Yeah. And, and, like, why&mldr;</p><a href=#001328-learning-to-go-deep-explore-vs-exploit><h2 id=001328-learning-to-go-deep-explore-vs-exploit><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[00:13:28] Learning to Go Deep: Explore vs. Exploit </h2></a><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Speaking of maybe the curiosity part of it, you&rsquo;ve talked in a few different contexts about what I would describe as sort of this fun, curiosity-driven orientation versus this, like, work ethic, grind orientation. You&rsquo;ve said you don&rsquo;t love practicing. I think that was specifically in the context of drumming. There&rsquo;s another excerpt. You say, &ldquo;I really thought I&rsquo;d try to get into Berklee and seriously try to become a great jazz drummer. I suppose that I&rsquo;ve always lacked the discipline and practice ethic that&rsquo;s required for that. I had to learn over time the bolts in the art I make and in life. I have to turn being a dilettante into a strength. I&rsquo;m not the guy who&rsquo;s gonna shoot 10,000 free throws until I&rsquo;m Michael Jordan. did happen kind of accidentally that I said, &lsquo;Okay, yeah, I&rsquo;ll try singing.&rsquo; But the process of being an artist in the world was so compelling because of the freedom it gives you. I feel that way about everything I do, not just music. I want the e- that ethic of being independent and open-minded, having a lot of integrity intellectually to be part of anything I do.&rdquo; And so maybe I&rsquo;m reaching here, but it feels like you&rsquo;ve very much continued with the spirit of that, that last bit, regardless of the, of the domain. And whether it&rsquo;s investing broadly, or science and bio and medicine now, you&rsquo;re clearly very curiosity driven, but you also have, at least from what I can tell, a pretty remarkable ability to go deep. And you might call yourself, like, a dilettante, but, like, I, from what I&rsquo;ve read and heard and heard about you, you have a, kind of a radical amount of depth, at least in certain contexts. So, I&rsquo;m curious how you balance that energy we were just talking about, the surfing the web, pure explore energy, with the ability to exploit and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually gonna get really rigorous.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> I think the rigorous part, there, there&rsquo;s a level of depth I can get to where I don&rsquo;t need new skills. You know, which is basically to say using just language and conceptual thinking-You can understand a lot of molecular biology, for example, you know, which is an area I spent time on in the past decade. Where I start to feel that tension with my sort of dilettante inner child is, is when you then need to actually learn a new skill.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> So, I&rsquo;ll give you an example. Right now, I&rsquo;m really interested in statistics, which was a subject I hated in, uh, high school, which was the only time I took it. And then, through my interest in investing and, and, and in particular, in systematic quantitative investing, which is something I&rsquo;ve been curious about for the past few years, I realized there are basic concepts that are used constantly that I never really got. So, for example, I don&rsquo;t actually know what a standard deviation is.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> You know? Like, what&mldr; Just, like, what, what is that?</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> And so, I was recommended by this really cool statistics professor at Stanford to get this old stats textbook that&rsquo;s been around for 30 years or whatever, and I bought it. It&rsquo;s a great textbook, and it&rsquo;s super well-written &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s&mldr; It&rsquo;s, you know, there are no pretentions. It&rsquo;s made to walk someone from knowing nothing through all the basic concepts. And so, I&rsquo;m really enjoying that, but it&rsquo;s&mldr; I have trouble pushing myself to do the problem sets.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> [laughs]</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> You know what I mean? It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s&mldr; I love reading the chapter. And then, okay, I know, for me to really internalize this sort of deeply-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Sort of like the, the, the scales or whatever in the musical context.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> Yeah. Now, I need to do 10 of them.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> And it&rsquo;s kinda like, when I feel like I got it, I&rsquo;m n- I&rsquo;m not gonna-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Okay</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; do the 10. You know? And I, and I&rsquo;m always kind of&mldr; I&rsquo;ve had this&mldr; I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s been deliberate or, or accidental, but I&rsquo;ve had this privilege of working, um, in my music career and now in my investing career with collaborators who are super deep technically.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> So, like my bandmate, Max in Chester French is really a prodigy musician and can play every instrument and write string arrangements by hand. And, you know, like, that&rsquo;s kind of a crutch for me. T- it&rsquo;s good. I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s complementary skills-</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right, right</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> &mldr; is a different way of putting it.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> But I&rsquo;m always sort of in awe of people who can do the thing I can&rsquo;t, which is this kind of relentless, deep focus.</p><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> And probably actually enjoy getting really, really up close to that.</p><p><strong>D.A.:</strong> They love&mldr; Yeah, yeah. They, they love it. You know, like their happy place is doing that all day. And I, I get it and I admire it, and I&mldr; Part of me wishes I were like that, but I&rsquo;m not. So, the best I can do is kinda work with people like that. But then when you do, they also raise your game. So, you, you know what I mean? You, you go from being totally non-technical to being, like, much more seeming&mldr; You know, when you say, like, &ldquo;Oh, it seems like you have depth or something,&rdquo; let&rsquo;s say, in, in biology.
