As a result, I had to deprioritize A) running/gym B) going into office C) photography D) cooking.</p><p><em><strong>In terms of career:</strong></em>
I&rsquo;ve cold-emailed around 20-30 people across product, operations, recruitment, and founding teams.
I&rsquo;ve succeeded in scheduling 10 exploratory calls.
Three of my efforts were for Tandem, which was quick to move me through the strategy & ops pipeline, but my failures to pass (or even summon the will to prep) the first case round elucidated how important <em>form-context fit</em> is for my next role. I need to a) find a role that&rsquo;s as close to product management as possible (S&amp;O won&rsquo;t cut it &ndash; it&rsquo;s too close to consulting) b) find a problem space I&rsquo;m intellectually passionate about (prior authorization also not a fit - i can&rsquo;t even figure out my own health insurance) and c) find a company at the right stage (tandem probably could have fit this but again, probably too early for me). In a way I&rsquo;m a bit turned off when the company is TOO young - it&rsquo;s important to find somewhere with a path to product mentorship, and that requires co-workers / leaders who have done product before.</p><p><em><strong>In terms of writing:</strong></em>
In some part spurred by making writing club a thing & helping Cartesia out with its narration feature, I&rsquo;ve committed to writing weekly on Substack.</p><p>Super rewarding to follow up on my birthday cafe with a writing event and fold in some of my situational friends (co-workers) into my hobbies. By nature of my friends I&rsquo;m trying to target thoughtful girlies (or guys!) who are great conversationalists, open-minded, and first-and-foremost warm. The actual passion for writing comes second; I think even someone who journals would enjoy the writing club.</p><p>Speaking about my writing and speaking about Substack is inextricable. But while this platform has given me the confidence to consider writing as a hobby & practice, it&rsquo;s becoming clearer that Substack is not the end state. It favors short snappy pieces on universal feelings (love/friendship/intimacy) and less so on deep dives into my own intellectual curiosities &ndash; at least in the niche I&rsquo;m in. There are goals I have for my writing that I believe swell beyond the constraints of a newsletter: cultural anecdotes reminiscent of lit mags, deep dives into rabbitholes on infrastructure/urbanism, interactive websites for &ldquo;scrollytelling.&rdquo; My hesitation is that all of these ideas require a concerted writing effort with a feedback loop way longer than Substack, and I&rsquo;m stuck in a cycle of waiting to get enough conviction to full-send a project &lt;> getting distracted by smaller writing stints.</p><p>My efforts to submit to more-established publications are half-baked. I submitted an application to Works In Progress and unsurprisingly hadn&rsquo;t heard anything back, but I&rsquo;m proud of myself for the audacity to try. I tried to push for a story on Lai Rai & cultural wine bars for off-menu mag, but the burden of coordination fell on me and chasing an unresponsive IG account, so I didn&rsquo;t make the mag&rsquo;s end of March deadline.</p><p><em><strong>In terms of branding:</strong></em>
This theme has come up many times, both in convos with [Justin](
<a href=https://a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/ rel=noopener>1,000 True Fans? Try 100 | Andreessen Horowitz</a>) as well as my personal spare cycles for the events I host. Let me delineate between my personal & community branding efforts.</p><p>It&rsquo;s no secret I&rsquo;m an externalizer and Internet-native, but I&rsquo;ve never quite cracked down creating an intentional persona on the interwebs. Authenticity is a core value, and parasocialism & social panopticism & performance freak me out. At the same time, there&rsquo;s only positive returns from establishing some sort of brand or story or throughline that ties all your disparate internet identities together. I write, I take photos, I like to talk to interesting people and gather them together, I&rsquo;m interested in AI and its future, I like rabbit holes and the cultural layer atop the Internet &ndash; but <em>who is Annie</em>?</p><p>To try and answer this question is setting myself up for dissatisfaction, so instead, let me address what I&rsquo;ve been doing to brand <em>Annie</em>. I posted more on Twitter in the week of March, aware that I need to warm up my timeline before I tweet something about Cartesia. I spent a fair amount of time on Figma [creating](
<a href=https://x.com/AnnieZhou13/status/1899529293161546022 rel=noopener>annie z 🍳 on X: &ldquo;what is nostalgia but a false memory? inspired by a recent trip to flushing with my family, i followed our footsteps backward—from suburban new jersey to flushing food courts to a shanghai that&rsquo;s moved on without us. (1/5) https://t.co/fA24nsmEdk&rdquo; / X</a>) visuals for my Substack post on Flushing Food Courts, chalking up the effort as reps for a future cultural zine project &ndash; it did ok. My tweet about Cartesia&rsquo;s Narration Feature did get impressions because I piggybacked off of their brand & launch &ndash; but I question how much impact this sort of beta user / customer story has on both Cartesia&rsquo;s launch success & my own branding. Was this just a one-off experiment?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit more successful on Substack: posting regularly on Notes with some hits getting 40 - 200 likes. Nothing has really translated to remarkable growth on my actual writing, however; even when I try to write towards what is popular & poetic, the algorithm doesn&rsquo;t really pick up my writing and I rely on the support of my personal network.</p><p>I hosted two main events: my birthday cafe and a writing club. Both were highly intentional, high-effort in terms of branding, and quite successful (in terms of personal fulfillment & perceived group impact). My birthday cafe was a sprint to bring my vision to life &ndash; I made Pinterest boards, a detailed plan of to-dos, stickers, logos, menus, as well as asking for participation from my friends. Also so so so much matcha. I think the only thing I regret is not being able to control its documentation &ndash; I so wish I could exist in 3rd POV and take photos as well, or create a lil IG reel, or even remember to take photos of myself with the matcha. But that&rsquo;s the tradeoff between event host / event attendee / event documenter and a tension to explore another day.</p><p>For writing club, I also came up with a core motif (wayward writers / intended to sound like way WORD writers / intended to evoke the idea of following your curiosities and going on a &ldquo;random walk&rdquo;). I made an IG & Justin suggested a newsletter dedicated to it. I want to spin this into something more, maybe a testbed of passionate individuals who would be inclined to go on a writing retreat / submit to a &ldquo;club&rdquo; zine / join a self-organized &ldquo;camp&rdquo; class in the summer.</p><a href=#takeaways><h3 id=takeaways><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Takeaways</h3></a><p>I am quite satisfied with my March - in part my birthday & anniversary at work gave me an additional sprint of energy to commit to exploring opportunities for jobs & locking into writing. There was a weekend where I overwhelmed myself with social activities, and I tried to course correct by not proactively planning hangs in the following couple of weeks and only accepting in-bound. While I had more space to breathe in those weekends, I gave up control over the types of activities I did - so had fewer photo walks, runs, cafe hangs, etc. I am happy I cut out going to random internet events (aside from a couple Verci ones). In a way I do want to go out more but I just wonder if I&rsquo;m not that type of person.</p><p>Looking forward to April, I want to reprioritize fitness as I have a half-marathon I&rsquo;ve avoided thinking about. Now that I&rsquo;ve collected a healthy number of datapoints on startups, I want to focus on reaching out to opportunities that truly fit my profile & interests; there is no pressure to jump ship & compromise. I want to choose one dedicated writing project to hone on, whether it&rsquo;s a research piece or a short story or another cultural reflection for the zine. I also want to cook + bake more; I&rsquo;ve had some excellent meals this March thanks to my friends but I also miss making creative recipes.</p><a href=#monthly-review-1><h3 id=monthly-review-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Monthly Review</h3></a><p><em>Thanks to Justin for the Claude prompt + idea.</em></p><a href=#week-1-march-1-2><h2 id=week-1-march-1-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Week 1 (March 1-2)</h2></a><ul><li><strong>Sat, March 1</strong>: Sister hang (10am -
