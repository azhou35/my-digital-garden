<em>only by externalization, by entering into social relationships, can we develop the interiority of our own person.</em> remind yourself of this, in your most introverted moments, when you&rsquo;re battling some false self truth about myself and i want to spin cycles in my room to figure it out. it&rsquo;s comfortable to sit within your own feelings, easier to construct your own self-truths and spin a narrative. but you need thought partners, attuned to your prickly edges and soft spots, to help mold you and pull you out of a rut.</p><p>thankfully there are friends who pull you out of the mess interiority can become. a conversation with yourself is very affirming and comfortinh but it also limits how vast it is the field u transverse.</p><p>the first rooms one may enter, maybe hidden under the bed in your bedroom or somewhere in the attic or even the top shelf of the bathroom. this inner landscape is built from your childhood obsessions, the books that rewired your brain, the fears you&rsquo;re still working through, the dreams you&rsquo;re almost embarrassed to admit.</p><p>what we first project to the world is our facade, and these are the most salient features people will lump you into. picture these as the outside rooms, the foyer and entrances. a projection is a lossy image, taking the complex multidimensionality of uor interior: such as, &ldquo;<em>i have a deep rooted curiosity to try new things because of an whimsy for the world</em>&rdquo; and flattens it into easy labels: &ldquo;<em>i started pottery!</em>&rdquo;</p><p>the problem is that multiple different interiors, when flattened, can look like the same exterior label. when put into 1D, a circle, square, and triangle could all appear as a line. how do show your true self and discover another&rsquo;s?</p><p>based on your race/profession/fashoin sense one may clock you as an academic, or a yuppie, or a diy-er.</p><p>to be in a city is to brush shoulders with a myriad of interesting folks at parties and friends&rsquo; parties and galleries. inevitabily you will find people who you feel that mild spark, <em>squish,</em> as you will, where you&rsquo;re seized with the feeling that you could become friends.</p><p>here&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve learned: that spark means nothing if you don&rsquo;t know how to move past the entryway.</p><p>any time i meet someone for the first time, there is a mix of anticipation and anxiety that almost likens to a first date. visually i imagine it like being invited to their house for the first time - you see
the first conversation involves idling at their entryway, looking for the right place to enter within.</p><p>most people never leave the entrance. they exchange pleasantries about the weather, complain about the subway, ask what you do for work. it&rsquo;s conversational treading water—safe, but it gets you nowhere. i call this <em>foyer talk:</em> the lowest common denominator of topics that anyone can quickly dip their toes in, if the water were freezing and you didn&rsquo;&rsquo;t want to stay too long.</p><p>when you enter someone&rsquo;s interiority, do so with grace and love. take your shoes off before you come in, keep in check the biases and baggage you may bring with you.
tiptoe, tenderly. picture these as <em>living room conversations</em> - the opinions and interests that exist at our underying layer.</p><p>i picture myself an archaeologist when i approach these conversations. what is our common ground? maybe more interestingly, where do our realities misalign?</p><p>there&rsquo;s a tension here, to playing this probing role. conversations are best when both parties are authentic. i confess, there are moments where i slip into my fake voice and the conversation can go on auto-pilot. or even to get to an equilibirum with a stranger, i will posture, ever slightly, to pull out the annie that&rsquo;s most endearing to them.</p><p>but here&rsquo;s the thing: good conversations, with authentic folks with a grasp of their interior shape, are truly generative. in these scenarios, both parties are united in their discovery having identified some exciting, amorphous common ground. delicate tools at hand,</p><p>in <em>conversations have dooorknobs,</em> the artful dance of giving and taking in a conversation create affordances, like stairs and tables and doorknobs.</p><p>if a conversation with a burgeoning friend is like a buttoned up house party, one with a close friend is like crashing at a friend&rsquo;s place on short notice. by now you&rsquo;ve put your guards down and can come as you are: messy, bedraggled, still fuming from the 12092 things that went wrong in your day. or maybe, the one very Heavy Thing that&rsquo;s been your burden all month. you are attuned to each other&rsquo; quirks, to the language by which you construct the world, the characters in your life.</p><p>this scratches the idea of bedroom talk on fears, dreams, deep stuff.</p><p>during contact points with the friends who get me, i come alive.</p><p>rare entry ways are provided by people wh are artists and share their internal state of thinking. through photography, dance, music.
so where do we find these people who magically make us come alive? counterintuitively it reuires a better sense of self.
contrary to the name, to develop one&rsquo;s interiority does do best in tandem with others. the right thought partners sharpen you, hold a mirror to your shape and illuminate it into being.</p><p>entryways dont have to be conversations - it can manifest through art. perhaps this is why a performance, art exhibition, can move us so, even if we&rsquo;re not physically in proximate. going to a friend&rsquo;s performance is the greatest joy - you shortcut into their inner sensibilities far more than a conversation can get you.</p><p>this is something i remind myself during my most introverted moments, when im battling some false self truth about myself and i want to spin cycles in my room to figure it out. thankfully there are friends who pull you out of the mess interiority can become. a conversation with yourself is very affirming and comfortin but it also limits how vast it is the field u transverse.</p><p>perhaps my favorite thing about well-written novels is how they&rsquo;re portals into someones interiority. you literally step into a character&rsquo;s world, imbue their worst fears and idle observations. it&rsquo;s a meaningful way of perspective, to see lens by which they observe things. authors like victoria woolf, dostevesky, proust, so beloved for this superpower: switching the reader&rsquo;s place with the character. a good conversation is the closest real life way of tapping into this.</p><p>there are many ways i could hold my friendship graph to the light and scrutinize the way that mutuals connect, the hobbies and values and common interests and flavors of activities that hold us together. but at the end of the day, friendship boils down to two things: good humor, and a good heart.</p><p>questions to answer: how to chat with a new friend
this is a conversation about authenticity.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by anniez using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2026</p><ul><li><a href=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/azhou35>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/azhou35>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
