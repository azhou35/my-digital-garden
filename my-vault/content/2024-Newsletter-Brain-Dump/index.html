Pre-move to NYC, I thought a lot about how to make friends when I was moving at an unconventional time - mid winter, when most of my peers have yet to enter and my older friends have already established friend groups of their own. My life felt like spurts cycles of friend making that sparked and faded once we all left the phase we were in - my short time in college, internships, study abroad.

I jotted down many side projects and events in 2024. And many never came to life. What’s holding back some of my dreams?

What motivates you?</strong>
Hobbies took a central stage when I landed in the city. At my first party I dragged Vincent along and we breathlessly introduced ourselves to strangers with our full bio - major, school, job, company. We soon realized that people shed these labels at events (for the most part). People hand-wave the industry - <em>tech, business, art</em> - and instead talk about their hobbies and interest.
It was the first time of my life the conversation didn&rsquo;t feel hell-bent on whatever prestige label we were chasing.
Writing became core to my identity in 2024.
I thought about the importance of community driving creativity and vice versa. Creativity requires sparks which come from friends and acquaintances also working</p></li><li><p><strong>What is your relationship to work? Where did you strive or falter?</strong>
My relationship with work has only started. In many ways I am grateful for the privilege it affords me - to work in the role I&rsquo;ve coveted, remotely.
I learned the benefits and consequences of remote work.
I faltered in setting a routine. When work is flexible it&rsquo;s easy for it to fall into the background. I feel physically disconnected from the main purpose of life, and thus it fees less like a purpose and more like a chore.</p></li><li><p><strong>What were the sources of intimacy this year? How did those change? Did you love someone or learn to love yourself more this year?</strong>
I believed the capacity to love only increased this year. I put myself out there openly on the Internet. I told people about my feelings seriously at parties and random events.
I discovered the word &ldquo;navel-gazing&rdquo; &ndash; ompha­loskeptical &ndash; and I learned what happens when fellow over-thinkers come together.</p></li><li><p><strong>What was different from 2023?</strong>
