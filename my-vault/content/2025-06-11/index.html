clearly i am very upset bc waht is abundantly obvious to my peers and boyfriend is less obvious to me being in the situation
i dont actually know what to do all day</p><p>what sort of work energizes me?
nitins questions:</p><ul><li>do you feel ilke you&rsquo;re contributing to society? do you fee sharp?
why are you not happy about this job?
i feel listless</li></ul><p>if i stay at microsoft:</p><ul><li>stay until september</li><li>start recruiting again for pm ii (?) roles elsewhee
what doesnt change:
general existentialism / unhappiness with work
general ennui</li></ul><p>What should be important:</p><ol><li>ur working on product work, not just tpm work</li><li>it&rsquo;s a greenfield opportunity that can really expand into anything</li><li>i will work hard, for once in my life</li></ol><p>the question is - how much do i want to leave?
meeting up with other microsoft pms at a recruiting event validated that some of my anxiety over wanting to leave is seeing others leave - for some reason i want to do things before other people leave.</p><p>i feel deeply disconnected from my work life. i have nothing to do except sit on syncs i dont need to speak on, lead meetings that people dont attend, write documents that people dont read. my real value prop is creating a schedule that guides which updates go where.</p><p>from november: ughughughugh i feel this constant battle of 1) im not doing enough or living up to my potential and 2) i need to give myself grace and work within the structure that im placed within
how do i reckon that institutions are set in their own ways?
i dont rly have a growth mindset at microsoft &ndash; i feel very stifled and confused on where to go when i think about it</p><ul><li>mitra thinks that im too junior to actually drive anything -> so i act as if i dont have any power to drive anything -> im stressed before even
how do i define ambition in the workplace?</li></ul><ul><li>i ask my manager for more work and i&rsquo;m told to slow down. there&rsquo;s a fine line between wanting to rush ahead vs staying within the guard rails of big tech. i&rsquo;m in fact probably lucky that my previous internships have all been self-driven and highly ownable, which almost makes the reality blow harder.</li><li>am i running on the hedonic treadmill/rat race? or am i settling for complacency?</li><li><ul><li>i feel a pressure to succeed to a level past my dad, who capped out at md. i understand that growth at a structured company isn&rsquo;t guaranteed, esp as a female asian in the workplace. in microsoft i dont see myself climbing to the top, as the people on my team are older yet only a few levels higher.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>is working for microsoft in gpus what im truly passionate about?
what future joy are you delaying
with your current life?
i dont know
this trip is going to make me re-evaluate how i feel about my job</p><p>Thinking about whether to leave your job is uncomfortable in a few different ways: it involves acknowledging that you made a poor decision in the past (taking your current job) that wasted a bunch of time; it involves signing up for a bunch more difficult, stressful work to interview at new jobs; and it saps your motivation to invest in getting better at your current job if you think it’s likely that you’ll leave soon. So it’s understandable that people procrastinate on staring into that abyss. But that procrastination leads to a lot of avoidable suffering</p></li><li><p>i wouldnt outwardly call myself ambitious, but as someone constantly striving</p></li><li><p>we are people who are looking for our <strong>life&rsquo;s work</strong> &ndash; before we get to our magnus opus is a series of failed pivots</p></li><li><p>i&rsquo;m looking for the thing that will define my career</p></li></ul><p>that day i was walking jainil&rsquo;s dog with mahesh, he asked me when i felt on top of the world from a career high. honestly, i didnt have anything to say from my internships/job, but the first image that came to mind was when i was hosting events in high school and post-grad: the hackathon i incepted in junior high school, bookbear matchmaking event, picnic. i&rsquo;m still searching for that high, where i feel like i create something out of nothing and it actually has impact. the scope doesn&rsquo;t even have to be that big &ndash; something like event planning is localized to the people i know.</p><p>report out how the testson schedule</p><p>whenthis thing kicks off </p><p>they only care about when they get capacit back</p><p>target:60% after 2 1/2 days</p><p>see if we hit that target</p><p>how was plannnedmaintenancedone before

can organize and ask question</p><p>document how we build how we build a supercomputer
shrink time to build a sc fom months to week</p><p>how do you know when something is the right decision to make?</p><p>obviously i will never truly know. there is no decision handed to me on a silver platter.<br>do i stand for complacency and an easy path to promotion at my current job? or do i feel the impatience to jump and move to another startup at this very moment?</p><p>who is the person i want to be versus the person i am today? i want to leave but the actual logistics behind launch feel weighty.</p><p>am i waffling on this decision because it feels hard? or because it feels wrong?
if i back out on my decision now i have to be completely sure that this is not the right fit for me at this moment. there is a knot within my chest constantly tightening the more i deliberate this. i hate this liminal space between microsoft and scale, in which im not sure how i feel about this opportunity and constantly dawdle.</p><p>the delusion is: commitment is a thing that you feel. The truth is: commitment is a thing that you make.</p><p>This is why commitment architecture is a skill. It requires a deep understanding of just how far you can push yourself, and you can only get that through experimenting over time.</p><p>forcing functions need to have two things to work: real accountability, and real consequences.
The idea is that making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people.</p><p>-> is going to scale a moat of low status? eating shit just to learn something and grow into someone stronger?
-> theres also no need to take a job if i think im going to hate it
&ndash;> am i going to hate it? am i unnecessarily harsh on myself? what do i do?</p><p>a truth is that i find it difficult to commit to something. and especially difficult to make hard decisions. and decision paralysis is something that is truly, wholly, numbing. i will never know if making x decision over y will be good for me, but maybe there is only one way to try. i will never know if im making a quote unquote &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; by choosing one thing over the other. people will tell you that you&rsquo;ve made mistakes and i wont know how to respond.</p><p>what do i currently do at microsoft? i spend very little time working, and a lot of time sitting in meetings and soaking in information.</p><p>what do i ideally want to be doing? i like getting things to do and driving towards outcomes. maybe this career is just not for me if i don&rsquo;t have anything to do. truth be told this job is so easy for me and maybe a little crazy i just landed it for doing nothing. i got a promotion and i didn&rsquo;t even have to try.</p><p>should i keep living life this way?</p><p>what is my happiness equation? it&rsquo;s obviously the richness of life that comes from trying new foods, hosting events, writing, etc.</p><p>questions i need to clarify but perhaps will not really clarify anything:</p><ol><li>what does working on an evals product entail?</li><li>what is my pov on evals as a product in general?</li><li>how will this change with the potential meta partnership?</li><li>is scale still a good company to join?</li><li>could i still go into a startup if i stay at microsoft for one more year?</li><li>what kind of work experience do i want to have?</li><li>what can i learn at scale under john vs microsoft under aditya?</li></ol><p>several self-truths:</p><ol><li>i am looking for the moment/thing that&rsquo;s going to define my career/se
