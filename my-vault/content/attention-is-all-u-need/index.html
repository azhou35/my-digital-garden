Mary Oliver also reiterated this truth: “
<a href=https://theuncarvedblog.com/2019/01/17/rip-mary-oliver-thank-you-for-sharing-your-poetic-gifts-with-us-they-are-a-national-treasure/ rel=noopener>==Attention is the beginning of devotion==</a>.” It was her essential message for living a full life. She emphasized: “
<a href=https://theuncarvedblog.com/2019/11/28/mary-oliver-is-the-messenger-for-thanksgiving/ rel=noopener>==To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work==</a>.” She formularized it in this succinct 3-line poem, 
<a href=https://www.guideposts.org/inspiration/inspiring-stories/stories-of-hope/mary-olivers-instructions-for-living rel=noopener>==Instructions for living a life==</a>: Pay attention. / Be astonished. / Tell about it.
4. too often do i move my weekends on autopilot, my google calendar schedule leading my footsteps from one back-to-back hang. eyes glued to my phone. too often is my body in a bar at midtown and my mind a million light years elsewhere, transversing space and time and thinking about anything but the now.</p><p>my favorite quote from a24 is the one from lady bird: &ldquo;love and attention - are they not the same thing?&rdquo; i used to perceive love as a form of possession. now i wonder if it&rsquo;s more like composition &ndash; in our conversation, move as a photographer would, an act of framing & focus, of knowing which lights and angles best highlight someone. when i turn my lens towards you, it is an attempt to distinguish the essential from the consequential.
1. i&rsquo;m a big fan of street photography as a way of seeing the world. when you focus a camera lens, you point it towards your subject and it tries to differentiate the outline, separate the foreground from the background, focus on your visage. conversations with a friend are a bit like this - directing your gaze towards a subject, with the intent to capture their idiosyncracies, with a hope that you can understand how the pixels connect.
6. yes, let me experience new things together. but maybe more importantly, let me appreciate your presence through daily rituals. <em>intimacy is not a proxy for connection</em> so let me try and understand you - see the way you measure out spices with your heart when we cook dinner after work, or when you stop in to pick up something you left behind and we linger in the doorway, or even shopping for snacks at trader joe&rsquo;s together.
7. i think my love language is something along the lines of gifts that indicate you are thinking of me. it manifests in emails with substack articles that remind us of each other, late night texts when we&rsquo;re angry at a coworker, or stopping by when you&rsquo;re in the neighborhood.
8. maybe all love is attention to detail, intention to care. tendencies of attention are inherited: i grew up with parents who watched which food i gravitated, who send me pictures of any bunny memorabalia they see in the store. in the same way, i remember your favorite fruit is mango and bring some for you next time. i see the book we talked about and send you a text about it.<br>9. in a way, sometimes i think n knows me better than myself. ada limon&rsquo;s said: To be made whole / by being not a witness, / but witnessed. i resist definition but there&rsquo;s something comforting in being seen by another. <em>if we want the rewards of being loved we have to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known.</em>
10. at a late-night hang with friends we chat about <em>bids for attention</em>. if you&rsquo;re walking down a road with someone and point at a cool bird, it&rsquo;s less about how cool the bird really is - it&rsquo;s the fact that your friend thought the bird was cool to call out and there&rsquo;s something inherently special about that point of view.
11. is it any surprise that the root of the word attention is attendere, then latin word <em>tendere</em> - to stretch towards? are we not in the continual ritual of outstretching our hands, a request to be held by the other?
12. we are looking for anchors to hold onto each other. presence relies on the mundane everyday. it means you show up, over and over again. when you give presence whole-heartedly, you are giving another assurance that you will always be there. that in the future when they need someone to lean on they can come to you.
13. i believe in cosmic bids for attention, intentions from the natural reaching out and demanding attention.</p><p>but crowds can feel constricting, especially when you are untethered from a companion or a purpose. i mytholize it; the open jaws of a subway swallowing commuters whole,
tattoeed with words, pockets of vulnerability on your morning commute.</p><p><img src="/my-digital-garden/Pasted image 20250326143430.png" width=auto>
when i am graced by conversation with you, let me be flooded by your being. i am talking to you, as well you of your childhood, as well as you in the future.</p><p>let me turn this on my head. i hate self-portraits of myself.
your presence lingers, even when we walk away.</p><p>attention to detail, intention to care. quickly i remember your favorite fruit is mango and bring some for you next time. it&rsquo;s the way we joke about asian parents bulk ordering us food when they&rsquo;re far away - attention is doing everything we can in our puny human capabilities to make the other person feel esen.</p><p>presence relies on the mundane everyday. it means you show up, over and over again. when you give presence whole-heartedly, you are giving another assurance that you will always be there. that in the future when they need someone to lean on they can come to you.</p><p>presence lingers, even when your friend is gone. it manifests in emails with substack articles that remind us of each other, late night texts when we&rsquo;re angry at a coworker, or stopping by when you&rsquo;re in the neighborhood.</p><p><em>Don’t you think maybe they are the same thing — love and attention?”</em>
i stand by the theory that friendships are inherently romantic. a relationship is the biggest holding pen for attention together &ndash; to hold someone within your gaze, to understand them, completely, unwaveringly.</p><p>friendships:</p><ul><li>sharing personal lore</li><li>sending memes</li><li>inviting to events</li><li>soliciting advice</li><li>referencing shared experienes</li></ul><p>so many people are
i think</p><p>I need to be intentional about giving my full attention to whom and what I love. Too often I have moved through days on a sort of autopilot, with my attention consumed by distractions and trivialities.</p><p>We are surrounded by wonders and trudge on by without notice. An occasional pause for reverent astonishment would be a potent tonic.</p><p>And maybe I should take note of what I truly pay attention to consistently and see if there are hidden objects of affection I’ve been oblivious to.</p><p>In an increasingly distracted world, paying attention is a powerful gift and the ultimate expression of love.</p><p>But most of all, I begin to really see people when I slow down. A woman at the bus stop, her hair tied back in a way that speaks more of function than fashion as she scribbles tiny words onto a tiny notepad. Her gaze dithers between the horizon, willing the bus to appear, and the page that is getting increasingly crumpled the faster she writes. She hurriedly pushes the notepad into her bag as the bus arrives, and I catch a glimpse of a collection of other slightly-crumpled tiny pages filled with tiny writings as she flips through them to close the pad. The man across from me on the train has tired eyes. He’s reading a book and I tilt my head to catch the title. It’s a battered paperback, the book as weathered by time as the man himself. I’ll never know what he thought of it but, for the length of the journey, his quiet presence became a part of mine. Seeing him read the book is important to me. On that train carriage, there were 7 people reading. This is an unusually high proportion; usually I would expect to see someone important with a briefcase scrolling through Twitter (I have never been able to bring myself to call it X), someone’s mother on level 1000 of Candy Crush, a teenager having a loud FaceTime gossip session. On that train carriage, I felt oddly validated in my attempt to slow it down. Me and my book, 7 strangers and theirs.</p><p>[What is love without the lavishing of attention on the other party? Conversely, what is the act of attention but love? The attention that a parent might give a child in a strained relationship? The attention that someone struggling with their identity might give to the person they’re dating? The attention that a teenager might give to their best friend?</p><p>The attention that you give those around you, just by being present.
The tragedy that Lady Bird reveals is how unfortunate it is that sometimes we give that love only when we’ve left a place behind.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/tag/film?source=post_page-----1df46bca5fa1---------------------------------------" rel=noopener><br></a></p><p>](
