We found our rhythm through weeknight stops at the Italian grocer, weekend trips to seafood festivals. while i yawned and groaned through chinese school, my parents practiced their English on orders of rigatoni and lobster rolls. in doing so, they traded the comfort of community for the comfort of control.</p><p>it&rsquo;s a calculation instinctive to immigrants: cultural belonging versus their children&rsquo;s opportunity. <em>new jersey was the best place to raise you,</em> and they say it so often i almost believe it. with every move they made they went further from their roots and closer to the american dream. manicured lawns and strip malls and vehicular freedom.</p><hr><p>shanghai, i stood in a six-story mall food court, watching a robot glide between pristine tables with a tray of bubble tea. in this foreign utopia you can&rsquo;t pay with card, let alone cash - every transaction is via WeChat Pay. with rows and rows of clean food stalls and pristine polished tables, the food courts here exude efficiency. the air smelled of nothing, a stark contrast from the constant smog of air pollution outside.</p><p>skyscraper shopping malls have surmounted an old playground, the xiao chi stands have turned into third wave cafes. the city has moved along. in the past ten years a dizzying array of mega buildings have struck shanghai&rsquo;s skyline, and many buildings have a feeling of being new but unused. spaces that arise out of design instead of necessity carry a special emptiness to them. when it&rsquo;s almost too easy to find a seat at the food court, they lose the human messiness that makes them feel alive. isn&rsquo;t it funny, the fronts we design as masks that hide our true selves?</p><p>facade: an

time last year i visited shanghai in search of the source material. but the food courts that i found came out of a utopia: hosted in malls that towered six floors high, with rows and rows of clean restaurants with robots as servers and payment by phone as the norm. sleek, shiny, but sterile and unused. modern food courts are efficient but lost the human messiness that made them feel alive. when spaces get too polished they lose that vital energy of survival and community: how ppl squeeze tg at tables, shouting orders, quick calculations. there are no messy idisonsyncratic chinese signs.</p><p>themes:</p><ul><li>how do we flatten a culture in our attempts to preserve it?</li><li><ul><li>The immigrant parent&rsquo;s sacrifice of community for opportunity</li></ul></li><li>community spaces out of necessity
when they moved to new jersey, their flushing trips became rare pilgrimages. the drive theoretically took one hour but in practice took two, thanks to the congestion built up on the dqbr. i mercilessly complained about the commute on the way there, but i&rsquo;d always forget about it when we reached our destination and i stumbled around the streets in search of the source of all the yummy smells. <em>this place is great. why didn&rsquo;t we stay?</em> from the look on their faces i could tell this was a question they have definitely considered. my parents often justify their move to me, explaining that New York was no place to raise a child.</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by anniez using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2026</p><ul><li><a href=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/azhou35>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/azhou35>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
