<a href=https://www.startingfromnix.com/p/intimacy-thresholds rel=noopener>intimacy thresholds - by Nix 🕊 - starting from nix ꩜</a></p><p>back then, i was wholly unaware of how much of myself i brought to a burgeoning connection. excited by the prospect of a new friend, i would overwhelm them with my lore - the breakup i was reeling from, the anxieties pressing into me about work and responsibilites, the deep yearning i had for something more. not too unlike a banana, over-ripening in the dark, until it bursts past its skin.</p><p>under the guise of vulnerability there are old friends i will spill myself out to. or maybe, if not invited, the secrets will bubble out from me and reveal themselves in conversation.</p><p>but at the end of the day, you have control over the intimacy you share. and maybe it&rsquo;s a power to diffuse this vulnerability with everyone i meet, and perhaps it&rsquo;s coincidence i meet so many people in the summer time.</p><p>to do: hone in specific examples with friends here</p><p>nostalgia spikes in summer.</p><p><strong>tension</strong></p><p>there is no proper way of tracking time in this season. there&rsquo;s this false promise of forever you can&rsquo;t control when the peaches ripen, where is the threshold between juices forming and flesh becoming overripe.</p><p>there&rsquo;s no way to track the timeline of a friendship, when you are 100 days away from the last time you&rsquo;ll talk, 50, 25, 1. every day is just a day until it&rsquo;s the last day before something ends.</p><p>i remember the first summer away from home: summer camp in high school, how endless it felt, how alive the freedom and newness made me feel.</p><p>but i never realized when would be my last summer at home. the summer before: dinners with my parents grilling in the backyard, bike rides around the block with neighbors, farmer market jaunts for the perfect jersey tomato. last time a place felt entirely mine.</p><p>such is the unspoken cruelty of ripening. there&rsquo;s a familiar the ache to a sweetness arriving too soon, too late. we have these false expectations of perfect ripeness, but in reality the sweetness di perfectly ripe
- friends gone too soon
- lovers started too soon
summer days end in one of two ways:</p><p>either they grow hot and heavy with humidity until they explode under its own tension and pressure</p><p>or the hot rapidly dissipates and one day you wake up and it&rsquo;s the fall breeze agian.</p><p>i&rsquo;d imagine summertime connections are like this.</p><p>i over-exert myself thinking about friendships and timing. that we&rsquo;re moving too fast, too slow, that i&rsquo;m revealing too much and they too little.</p><blockquote><p>I have always been scared of my own ripening</p></blockquote><p>and maybe love is a willingness to peel each other&rsquo;s layers. some people grab you despite the mess of it all. family, close friends. my mom asks how im doing and i start crying. there are people who pierce your tough skin and see you for the fruit that you bear within.</p><p>hey. maybe connection isn&rsquo;t forever, maybe it isn&rsquo;t some promise of endless summer. maybe under a certain someone&rsquo;s gaze, you ripen a little too quickly. it&rsquo;s that cliche people say, <em>friends stay for a season or a reason,</em> that sometimes makes me wanna rip my heart out.</p><p>but what we can offer is there and now, the presence we can offer.
isn&rsquo;t grand gestures or promises of forever but the here and now, the presence we can offer. small plates of fruit, clementines exchanged at lunch time.</p><p>forgive me, the mess i reveal of myself at ripening.</p><p><img src="/my-digital-garden/Pasted image 20250820190922.png" width=auto></p><p>berry picking always rings brighter in my mind.</p><p>these days all i think about is june. the sticky of salt down my wrist, sun&rsquo;s wandering eyes

i once wrote:</p><blockquote><p>the berries abound on burke-gilman trail & I am greedy, puncture their young skin before they fully ripen.</p></blockquote><p><a href=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/160707/in-my-next-life-let-me-be-a-tomato rel=noopener>In my next life let me be a tomato | The Poetry Foundation</a></p><blockquote><p>I have always been scared of my own ripening</p></blockquote><p>these days leave me in tears, more often than not. from thinking about friendships to thinking about work to thinking about this abstract person i want to be who i never could. that&rsquo;s the thing about memory, about anchoring yourself to past projections - you only imagine the future in its least-dimensional self, in paper images, and you cannot anticipate what it will actually feel like.</p><p>i once wrote - i wish to my life to be like a fruit</p><p>ocean once wrote his favorite fruit was the raspberry for they are so delicate they need to be picked by hand.
this summer is distinctly different, than most.
i have a funny theory that our relationship mirror fruits.
every relationship is either a soft shell or hard shell fruit</p><ul><li>soft shell, soft inside - fuyu persimmons - burst at the seams<ul><li>aka you make me feel so much and i feel so close to you i will literally overflow with conversation</li><li>raspberries - the most tender fruit that still needs to be hand-picked</li></ul></li><li>hard shell, soft inside - pomegranates<ul><li>harder to crack, but when it opens its jolting and surprising</li><li>bananas - also burst at the open, but the hard shell makes it mushy and leak out weirdly<ul><li>regardless of a hard shell, if my feelings are left to rot inside, they will inevitably spill out</li><li>i am embarassed when i hold in my emotions too long and they inevitably ooze out</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>timing, intimacy, authenticity</p><p><strong><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPChKGM5lbtC1UCV1816h3xha1ZDznu6w8v-bOFxMlhxABUfmCHQ9r4S_5tpkdhe0-nDiG_K8Dyrk5fHqQgDc67_3AfrvcENm4mq7JliVtBocOcqab14MNZhtXCx166jIaXj5PwcKrSw8TqkN0_h__hu8?key=RQCfvVBl7pw7ILEZai18Lg" width=auto alt></strong></p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by anniez using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2026</p><ul><li><a href=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/azhou35>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/azhou35>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
