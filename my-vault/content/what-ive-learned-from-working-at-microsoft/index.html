<a href=https://www.glennklockwood.com/garden/differences-between-AI-and-HPC rel=noopener>differences between AI and HPC</a>) software provider in the 2010s, and found itself well-positioned to provide the compute experience during the ai wave. i&rsquo;ve witnessed the team make a full transition from a product org to a capacity planning function. i joined expecting to drive a compute strategy for a new product division (biology) and instead fell into a world where we were laser-focused on one customer.</p><p>when you&rsquo;re in between a frontier startup customer and a ginormous company, you are squeezed from both ends: balancing speed with safety, progress with reliability,</p><p>to feed a gpu-hungry industries, hyperscalers have the raw compute and the reputation. but when you are a generalized battleship with roots in the cloud, it makes you ill-equipped for AI workloads.

Unlike hyperscalers, https://t.co/Kj78IgbqUW&rdquo; / X</a> ) that are purpose-built for AI have seen considerable results.</p><p>i also saw the hints of the partnership fraying, especially as openai diversified their compute providers and microsoft built out its internal microsoft ai team - it&rsquo;s a business move to [outsource](
<a href=https://x.com/RihardJarc/status/1977743106997928445 rel=noopener>Rihard Jarc on X: &ldquo;An interview with a former OpenAI employee that came over the weekend, confirming my hunch, which I already wrote about in the article last week, that the biggest friction between OpenAI and $MSFT is around infrastructure capacity: 1. OAI requests were &ldquo;leading to massive https://t.co/ELAAAkPVco&rdquo; / X</a>) some of the compute capacity to other providers and offset some of the risk for microsoft itself.</p><p><strong>org culture</strong></p><p>as a technical pm, i learned my job was really about <em>outcomes.</em> to drive forward a workstream is inherently managing a variety of stakeholders, all with varying relevance of real influence over your program. the role of a tpm is to thread the needle within organizations and find the highest leverage item to do.</p><p>it&rsquo;s a customer-facing role, but you really focus on one or two key accounts. typically the ic tpms would focus on various customers and cover ground on different domains (weather / finance /biology) and a manager would drive the strategy for the product.</p><p>there are gates everywhere - friction in getting permissions to access data, to accessing the notes of a program, to getting a simple kpi through. this is because we are an organization that prioritizes reliability and security and any sort of risk is disastrous.</p><p>you need an advocate for you at work. the best way to do this is through execution and to find other people who had chances taken on them when they were young, and i am extraordinarily lucky to have mentors who spotlighted me.</p><p>too much complacency breeds executive dysfunction.</p><p>at its best, microsoft incentivizes extreme diversity of folks with niche knowledge, especially when it came to the 100+ domains involved in running a supercomputer. however, it also means people could be wildly protective of their scope.</p><p>transparently, microsoft only operates well as a hybrid company due to the sheer size of the company, but this is also its huge limitation.</p><a href=#tpm--dev-relation><h4 id=tpm--dev-relation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>tpm &lt;> dev relation</h4></a><p>from college i wanted to be a product manager and fell more into tpm. a rule of thumb of a pm is to define the &ldquo;why&rdquo; and tpm is about the &ldquo;how&rdquo;, but the more natural role of tpm in my org is because we had become less of a product-driven org and more of a hardware/capacity planning one.</p><p>a friend once commented a pm has a bird&rsquo;s eye view of an org, keeps a pulse on org-wide politics. i believe a pm runs up and down the <a class="internal-link broken">ladder of abstraction</a> and therefore need to be highly autonomous (while still holding dependencies on all of their related teams.)</p><p>this is uniquely difficult and necessary at microsoft because of the remote-first culture, the wide company size, the preference for stability, among others.</p><p>a tpm is intended to make a dev&rsquo;s path from 0 to 1 as seamless as possible. this manifests through building automations, driving processes, managing customer interactions - but can also fall into the trap of clicking slides and culling emails.</p><p>i&rsquo;d describe many of the devs i had close relationships with as [site reliability engineers](
