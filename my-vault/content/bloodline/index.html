there&rsquo;s this dangerous arithmetic i do, some sort of twisted inductive projection - when i&rsquo;m 30 they&rsquo;ll be 70. when i&rsquo;m 35 they will be 75.
time dilation - time feels slowest at the beginnings and endings of our lives
at your youngest: with only few years accumulated, each year matters more
at your oldest: with only a few years left, you hold onto every minute
the truth is im terrified of outliving my parents.
every year is taking the math to its final end - when im 30 theyll be 68. when im 35 theyll be 73.
it already aches when they walk, their bodies already frail.
a child&rsquo;s experience of time upturns when they realize how old their parents are.
