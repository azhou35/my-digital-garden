nature is always in the purview here. but nature also serves to ground you. perhaps the biggest surprise to me as a forever east coaster is the sheer height of the californian reds. on a hike at land&rsquo;s end, i jerk my chin up at the trees that frame me, my neck nearly snapping like a stick. a mangled mixture descended in my throat that can only be described as fear and wonder.</p><p>suddenly your self-importance shrinks. and you feel very small.</p><p><strong>awe is anti-algorithmic, anti-personal brand, anti-main character energy.</strong> It asks us to consider that we might not be the center of the universe—and finds this possibility not deflating but liberating.</p><p>When the mountains are in the distance, I retain my agency, framing nature as I see fit. But when I&rsquo;m within the trees, their sheer magnitude dwarfs my figure. The difference isn&rsquo;t just physical—it&rsquo;s ontological.

Traditional sources of meaning that once anchored secular societies—religion, community, shared narratives—have faded away. Our alternative approach has been to relentlessly focus on <em>the self</em>, with constant personal goals and aesthetic fine-tuning.</p><p>But this approach often backfires, leading to a hedonic treadmill that makes us feel just as meaningless as we started. Social media amplifies this problem by turning our lives into performance art, where every moment must be optimized, curated, and broadcasted for validation.</p><p>this is where awe becomes radical. rather than shy away from inexplicable beauty, seek out experiences that overwhelm us. that&rsquo;s how you expand your capacity for wonder.</p><p>awe invites a paradox. do you find this enlightening - a comforting feeling of interdependence - or terrifying - a dizzying reminder of insignificance?</p><p>we have no control over when awe strikes but we can choose how we respond. we can either become terrified or empowered, retreating deeper within ourselves or move towards deeper understanding.</p><p><em>awe is a lightning bolt that marks in memory those moments when the doors of perception are cleansed and we see with the startling clarity what is truly important life.</em></p><p>the next weekend i flew to vegas for a music festival. vastness stretches her limbs outwards rather than upwards - etherized against the desert landscape and ripe for dissection. to get to the festival grounds entails a shuttle ride through the deserted air force complex - within the endless road of human ambition and artifice.</p><p><strong>can be a powerful source of awe</strong></p><p>in a crowd of people you lose yourself, in every sense of the phrase. here you lose all sense of time, all sense of self.</p><p>bass vibrates through your ribs and rattles in its new-found cage, transmitting movement to the rest of your body. pressed against the bodies of thousands, yet completely alone in the way that i perceive and react to the music.</p><p>But awe doesn&rsquo;t only come from nature. Sometimes it emerges from the most human of experiences: losing yourself in a crowd.</p><p>this is what psychologists call &ldquo;collective effervescence&rdquo;—that feeling of individual boundaries dissolving into something larger. when you put your phone down and stop yourself from documenting the moment, you surrender yourself to a collectiveness.</p><p>at one point during the night we mount the bleachers on the side of the stage to rest and observe the entirety of the festival in its totality. from this vantage point see the full scale of the stage, what two hundred thousand attendees look like from afar. as blood-red fireworks pierce the twilight sky i fixate on the tiny specks of people in the crowd at the main stage. if i had zoomed out of myself during the set, is this how i look like? an mote of dust in the distance, one of many in an endless desert?</p><p>you surrender yourself to the loss of control.</p><p>when william shatner first went to space, he expected to understand the full harmony of the universe. instead, he felt its fullest isolation.</p><p>the pale blue dot among other carl sagan books always fascinated me growing up. the syncresis of science: how a big bold universe is made up of tiny particles, how a scientist peers into a cell which makes up a whole living organism. based on what you&rsquo;re looking at you can use a telescope or a microscope.</p><p>the tailsend of may was marked by a trip to my partner&rsquo;s hometown, where i met his parents for the first time. deeply spiritual, their parents took me to the temple, where i soaked in the practices of age-old traditions - walking around the figureheads, touching the figureheads, kneeling down and kissing the floor. in this moment i felt the syncresis - pointedly individual and distinct while inexplicibly part of something greater.</p><p>this was the final chapter of awe: an understanding that there is something greater than the material world. buddhism, catholocism, hinduism, are all conduits of awe and an acknowledgement that there are certain phenomoena that escape explanation.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by anniez using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2026</p><ul><li><a href=https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/azhou35>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/azhou35>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
