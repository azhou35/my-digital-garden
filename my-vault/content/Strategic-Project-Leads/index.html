support AI model builders out there
ChatGPT, LLAMA - work w them from training data pov
26% of growth
company just to execute on this growth
within company - they solve problems within the Q
AI models - always learning more
Scale creates the data for students to learn
Build what the model builder wants them to do
a model builder comes to us and
have a growth team that goes out in the world and finds the contributors who are SMEs in math and create datasets in that sense
math olympiads / phds in math
brings them into outlier
ppl are inthe platform
SPL are managing these project teams contributing to this
can be 10 - 1000
managing these teams of contributors
how to help them produce the highest qualityd ata for customer
creating systems
finding efficiencies and making it better
starts all the way from starting with the math proj
maybe these ppl dont know
building benchmarks
understanding quality of data
are we building this
Growth team finds ppl in the world
creating datasets on time
delivery relationship w client
u are the person between contributor and
think about the tooling that Spl uses and the contributors
tooling is internal for SPL
if u see anything that can be improved you talk directly w PM
appreciate technical background
platform is like a gpt interface
this is how contributors interact w data
technicality - someone who can solve poblems
kpis for the role - quality of data + delivery of data in time
third kpi - new revenue generation
unlocker of revenue of scale
unlimited amount of demand for this data
if project goes quickly and good can go work on more clients
unlocks a lot of revenue
ppl within the first few projects can actually unlock money for scale
SPL can average 65-80 hours
creative writing / history</p><p>role was created last year
50-60 ppl
directly aligns wit revenue of company
dont have a limit for ppl
how much ppl can we hire can
GPUs chips - NVIDIA supports across the board

This was particularly challenging because we had competing demands from established enterprise customers, high-growth AI startups, and internal Microsoft research teams.</p><p>To make this decision objectively, I built a comprehensive data analytics framework using SQL dashboards that tracked several key metrics: utilization patterns, revenue per compute hour, growth trajectories, and strategic alignment scores for each customer segment.</p><p>The data revealed several unexpected insights. While enterprise customers generated higher immediate revenue, the usage data showed that AI startups were growing their compute needs at 3x the rate and were much more efficient with their resource utilization—running jobs at 85% efficiency compared to 60% for enterprise customers. The data also highlighted that certain research workloads, while not immediately revenue-generating, were enabling capabilities that our commercial customers would need within 6-12 months.</p><p>Based on this analysis, I made the decision to implement a dynamic allocation model that reserved 50% of capacity for high-efficiency growth customers, 30% for enterprise accounts, and 20% for strategic research initiatives. This was a significant shift from our previous static allocation model.</p><p>I presented this data-backed recommendation to our executive team with clear visualizations showing the projected 18-month impact. The decision was approved, and within two quarters, we saw a 22% increase in overall revenue and a 15% improvement in infrastructure utilization. Most importantly, this data-driven approach allowed us to make what could have been a contentious decision in a way that all stakeholders could understand and support, even if their immediate allocation was reduced.</p><p>This experience reinforced my belief that when facing complex decisions with competing priorities, collecting the right data and analyzing it systematically can reveal solutions that might not be obvious through intuition alone.</p><a href=#tell-me-about-a-time-you-had-to-scale-a-team-or-process-quickly-what-challenges-did-you-face-and-how-did-you-overcome-them><h3 id=tell-me-about-a-time-you-had-to-scale-a-team-or-process-quickly-what-challenges-did-you-face-and-how-did-you-overcome-them><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Tell me about a time you had to scale a team or process quickly.

The challenge was understanding resource utilization across thousands of VMs while identifying potentially fraudulent usage that affected legitimate AI customers.</p><p>For the SQL component, I designed a data pipeline that aggregated telemetry from multiple sources - VM metrics, scheduler logs, and customer data. The technical approach involved:</p><ol><li>Collecting raw telemetry across a rolling window and joining it with VM and customer metadata</li><li>Aggregating by customer, region, and VM size to establish usage patterns</li><li>Applying anomaly detection rules to identify suspicious patterns, such as high GPU with minimal CPU usage</li></ol><p>The SQL work required handling time-series data at scale, optimizing joins across distributed sources, and creating materialized views that supported real-time dashboards while processing terabytes of telemetry.</p><p>For the Python portion, I used pandas for data transformation and applied time-series analysis and clustering algorithms to identify usage patterns and outliers.</p><p>This analysis revealed that 8% of our GPU-enabled VMs showed signs of non-AI workloads, and we identified optimization opportunities that improved infrastructure utilization by 15%.</p><p>The business impact was significant: we implemented automated fraud detection that saved approximately $2M annually, and our capacity optimization insights directly improved service for high-value customers like OpenAI.</p><a href=#-how-do-you-identify-and-capitalize-on-growth-opportunities><h3 id=-how-do-you-identify-and-capitalize-on-growth-opportunities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>## &ldquo;How do you identify and capitalize on growth opportunities?&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Sitch: Opportunity came from our genomics research team, who had trouble using Batch given they came from a research background. Our hypothesis was that if our internal research team was having trouble, others would as well.
We started on a very scrappy process of prototyping a copilot to help researchers easily use our infra tools and presenting them to our contacts. As the PM I worked w two other members and drove research surveys in our internal global black belt network, went to local conferences like Supercomputing to speak, and built out a multi-agent copilot to demonstrate.
There was clear appetite to build out a platform.</p><a href=#describe-a-time-when-you-had-to-make-difficult-trade-offs-to-meet-deadlines-or-quality-standards><h3 id=describe-a-time-when-you-had-to-make-difficult-trade-offs-to-meet-deadlines-or-quality-standards><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Describe a time when you had to make difficult trade-offs to meet deadlines or quality standards.&rdquo;</h3></a><ul><li>Sitch: We need to carefully roll out updates to customers like OpenAI.
