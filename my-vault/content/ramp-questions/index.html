so i always grew up technical and appetite for entrepreneurship<br>went to engineering high school, but had a love for the humanities and made me love bridging the technical with the nontechnical
that brought me to cornell. i studied data science there, led our product development club, fell in love with nerding out to users and building something that helped their headaches - first product was a study buddy matching platform for the cornell dei office. confirmed product management is for me.
after college i joined microsoft because there was a rlly cool opportunity to work as a tpm on the ai infra team for microsoft, which has become relevant with our deal with OpenAI. so my team is really thinking about how supercomputing at scale looks like for openai and microsoft ai, really getting into the nitty gritty of the operational complexity of running these expensive machines for such a long time.</p><ul><li>it&rsquo;s been a great experience - i wear a lot of hats across strategy, operations, data analysis, and customer engagement<ul><li>i work closely with engineering team for azure batch which is a batch scheduling service for AI/ML workloads</li><li>really the data guru on our team<ul><li>develop analytics and telemetry usage dashboards for batch</li><li>dash boards for openai
where i am today is looking to build on this foundational experience and really take it to a faster moving environment. i learn the best when pushed to my limit, and really looking for somewhere with fast product lifecycle.
my role has ended up being way more operations heavy than expected - and it really aligns with what brought me to tech in the first place, which is building products that make processes easier for people. so i want to stilll work in the product world but really prioritize working at a startup,</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#why-ramp><h3 id=why-ramp><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Why Ramp?</h3></a><a href=#why-im-interested-in-ramp><h1 id=why-im-interested-in-ramp><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Why I&rsquo;m Interested in Ramp</h1></a><p>I&rsquo;m highly intentional about my next career move, and my attraction to Ramp boils down to three things: mission alignment, scope of impact, and people.
<strong>Mission Alignment</strong></p><ul><li>Raised by immigrant parents with the mindset that &ldquo;time is money&rdquo; and &ldquo;a penny saved is a penny earned&rdquo;</li><li>Drawn to how small time-saving adjustments lead to compounding financial benefits</li><li>Value Ramp&rsquo;s approach of reinvesting revenue into better software rather than extracting value</li><li>My product philosophy is that the best products create genuine value for users rather than extract from them</li><li>I mean I travel quite a bit for Microsoft, and whenever we use Concur, I think about how muc time and money we&rsquo;re wasting.</li><li>Its one of those day to day problems that ever person at an enterprise faces that its almost criminal to not work on this problem.
<strong>Scope of impact</strong></li><li>I care about being in a place and role where I can grow and execute from day one</li><li>Product Ops Specialist role allows me to directly influence how businesses control spending</li><li>Perfect alignment of incentives: my work directly connects to how Ramp makes money and how customers save money</li><li>Ramp is perf place to make impact - friend has described it as the smallest big company</li><li><ul><li>Take a high-level strategic view while also going deep on specific areas</li></ul></li><li>Serve as the &ldquo;engine of release&rdquo;
<strong>Ppl and Culture</strong></li></ul><ul><li>It&rsquo;s no secret in the tech world that Ramp is talent-dense</li></ul><ul><li>Witnessed this firsthand through conversations with friends at Ramp (Sherry and Zain)</li><li>Visited Ramp multiple times (Contrary talk, Anthropic MCP hackathon)</li><li>Environment reminds me of the energy at college hackathons</li><li>Culture of &ldquo;just do things&rdquo; (like Zain&rsquo;s DDR game project)</li><li>Thrive alongside people who are &ldquo;ruthlessly determined and engaged&rdquo;</li><li>Appreciate Ramp&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo;investing in slope over intercept&rdquo;</li><li>culture of supporting entrepreneurial talent - i know some alumni from cornell TK Kong have gone and started companies and been reacquired</li></ul><p>First, Ramp&rsquo;s mission to help customers save money really resonates to my core. I was raised by immigrant parents and by this idea that time is money - a penny saved is a penny earned - and im drawn by how making little adjustments to cut time lead to compounding money. And when I see Ramp reinvests revenue into better software, it perfectly aligns with my belief that the best products create genuine value for users rather than extract from them.
I mean I travel quite a bit for Microsoft, and whenever we use Concur, I think about how muc time and money we&rsquo;re wasting. Its one of those day to day problems that ever person at an enterprise faces that its almost criminal to not work on this problem.
Second is the scope of impact. Along with the mission, I care about being in a situation to grow and execute. The opportunity to drive business outcomes starting from day 1 is incredibly important to me. This Product Ops Specialist role within Spend Management allows me to directly influence how business control and optimize their spending, directly aligns with how Ramp makes money and how businesses save money. It&rsquo;s a perfect alignment of incentives.
Third is the people. It&rsquo;s no secret in the tech world that Ramp is talent-dense. ive been able to see it first hand with my friends, i talked to sherry about the product ops specialist role, my friend zain as well. This drive is exactly what I&rsquo;m looking for. I&rsquo;ve visited Ramp a couple of times, like Contrary talk and Anthropics MCP hackathon - and each time it feel slike the energy at college hackathons.
And you can just do things. Zain told me about a DDR game he was looking at for work and as silly and fun as it seems.
I thrive when working with people who are ruthlessly determined and engaged. Ramps rep for investing in slope over intercept matches exactly what Im looking for in my next opportunity.</p><ul><li>ramp&rsquo;s mission to incentivize its customers to save money is so elegant to me<ul><li>one of my fav classes in highschool was a history of engineering processes, and how things like just in time manufacturing reduced little details of a process and resulted in compounded effects</li><li>raised in an immigrant family - learned time is money - so im obsessive over saving / optimizing - time and money</li><li>a penny saved is a penny earned yanno</li><li>and i care very much about building products that are effective and positive sum for its users, not just trying to extract value out of them</li><li>and thats why im so frustrated when i either a) use clunky internal tools that by design are just hard to use and i waste time or b) i build and develop bloated tools</li><li>When I see Ramp&rsquo;s approach of reinvesting interchange revenue into better software rather than rewards points, it aligns perfectly with my belief that the best products create genuine value for users rather than extracting it from them.</li></ul></li><li></li><li>second is scope<ul><li>along with mission i care about being put in a situation where i can grow and execute. so the opportunity to drive towards business outcome starting day 1 is super important to me.</li><li>The product operations role within Spend Management would allow me to directly influence how businesses control and optimize their spending - which is directly aligned with how ramp makes money, and directly aligned with how these businesses save money</li></ul></li><li>third is rlly the people. its not secret in the tech world that ramp is talent dense - invest in slope over intercept - and i think this open mindedness and drive is exactly what im looking for in my next opportunity<ul><li>visited ramp a couple of times - for the contrary talk, for anthropics mcp hackathon</li><li>it reminded me of the energy of going to hackathons back in college or even what id imagine working at bell labs would be like - i thrive when working with people who are ruthlessly determined and engaged</li></ul></li><li>ramp&rsquo;s reputation for &lsquo;investing in slope over intercept&rsquo; matches exactly what I&rsquo;m looking for in my next opportunity</li></ul><a href=#tell-me-about-a-time-you-automated-a-process><h3 id=tell-me-about-a-time-you-automated-a-process><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tell me about a time you automated a process</h3></a><ul><li>Sitch: its so easy for cloud costs to get out of control, and our team is no exception. we were wasting multiple k&rsquo;s of $s bc people would provision VMs for demos and literally leave them running - and neve close them</li><li>Task: Knew something had to change, and the devs were just chasing down people one-by-one - deleting resources by clicking on each one and pressing the delete button - but with 4k resources I knew we needed a better solution</li><li>It&rsquo;s not fun or sexy being the cloud resource police. But I spearheaded and enforced up a process of regular maintenance and clean up. It&rsquo;s a simple solution, really, but I set up rules on how people should tag their resource if they wanted to keep it for longer than a month. And I wrote up a script that would automatically search for these untagged resources, and every month I would run it and it would check who hasnt tagged their resource, send out a warning email to their outlook, and if after a week they havent deleted it, it would automatically delete it.</li><li>Result is that we cleaned up over 3k+ subs, and I saved hours of headache for myself and for the devs.</li></ul><a href=#how-would-you-bridge-the-gap-between-customer-facing-teams-and-productengineering><h3 id=how-would-you-bridge-the-gap-between-customer-facing-teams-and-productengineering><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;How would you bridge the gap between customer-facing teams and product/engineering?&rdquo;</h3></a><ul><li>I think it&rsquo;s really about speaking a common language.</li><li>One example is a disconnect between what the engineering big problem with our Batch engineering team is that</li></ul><a href=#tell-me-about-a-product-you-have-launched><h3 id=tell-me-about-a-product-you-have-launched><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tell me about a product you have launched.</h3></a><ul><li>Sitch: our own research teams use batch and have said they had some trouble setting up their genomics research frameworks. we had the hypothesis that if our own teams are struggling, what about all the other researchers using us?</li><li>So i looked into the data and saw we had a sizable showing of people in the research field, but it was tapering off month by month.</li><li>This came around the same time we were experimenting with copilots for our own service - perfect opportunity to build a copilot that would help reduce the time to set up for these hpc researchers.</li><li>Built a multi-agent framework in python,</li><li>A unique experience within microsoft where we were working on a prototype and we could move faster</li><li></li></ul><a href=#tell-me-about-growth><h3 id=tell-me-about-growth><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tell me about growth</h3></a><ul><li>Sitch: Geting ppl to come to our HPC Researcher</li></ul><a href=#tell-me-about-a-time-you-used-data-to-influence-a-product-decision><h3 id=tell-me-about-a-time-you-used-data-to-influence-a-product-decision><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tell me about a time you used data to influence a product decision.</h3></a><p>&ldquo;At Microsoft Azure, I built SQL dashboards tracking AI workload usage metrics across our supercomputing infrastructure. The data revealed that certain customers were experiencing capacity constraints during peak research periods, while others had underutilized resources. I presented these findings to leadership with a proposal to implement dynamic capacity allocation, which improved infrastructure utilization by 20% and better served our high-value AI customers. The data-driven approach helped secure buy-in across technical teams and business stakeholders.&rdquo;</p><a href=#why-ramp-1><h3 id=why-ramp-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Why Ramp?</h3></a><p>When thinking about my next job, I want to find a place where I can a) learn a lot and b) accelerate.</p><p>First off, Ramp&rsquo;s culture seems to genuinely value growth and learning. I&rsquo;ve heard from connections and read about how the company invests in &lsquo;slope over intercept&rsquo; – looking for people who can grow and adapt quickly rather than just having the perfect background on day one. That really speaks to me because throughout my career, whether at Microsoft or when I was the first PM hire at Trusli, I&rsquo;ve always prioritized learning and scaling my impact over time.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also drawn to how Ramp is tackling real problems for businesses. At Microsoft, I loved connecting technical solutions to actual customer needs, and Ramp is doing exactly that – making financial operations simpler and more efficient for companies. The product is solving genuine pain points, not just creating nice-to-haves.</p><p>The fast pace and ambition at Ramp is super energizing too! You&rsquo;re not just iterating on an established product – you&rsquo;re redefining how businesses handle their finances. That reminds me of my work at Zing, where we were building something new that eliminated hours of manual work. I thrive in environments where I can move quickly and see the impact of my work.</p><p>Plus, the Spend Management team seems like the perfect fit for me. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed sitting at the intersection of data, customer needs, and product development. At Microsoft, I built SQL dashboards to track usage patterns, and at Cornell DTI, I connected user feedback to product improvements.
