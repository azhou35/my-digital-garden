looking at my list it&rsquo;s so obvious that this is where i&rsquo;d want to end up - at my old job my edge was working with openai on maintenance for compute, so it&rsquo;s only natural to seek jobs on the other side. however that option wasnt open to me so i tested hypotheses about my own pmf in the job market.</p><a href=#hypothesis-1-so><h5 id=hypothesis-1-so><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>hypothesis 1: s&amp;o</h5></a><p>when i started i presumed technical roles were out of reach, so i recruited for s&amp;o roles. i used n&rsquo;s network to start the conversation with <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/tandem-strategy-ops-role rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/tandem-strategy-ops-role>tandem</a> and i immediately got an interview - only to fail spectacularly at the <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/tandem-interview-1-notes rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/tandem-interview-1-notes>case study</a> on <em>prior authorization</em>. for <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/Ramp-Case-Study rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/Ramp-Case-Study>ramp</a> i also went through in-network - via sherry - and while i connected w the team members and poured my heart into my presentation, my data analysis ultimately fell short. (in hindsight, i did chatgpt my way thru the entire take home presentation).</p><p>with <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/ops-at-etched rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/ops-at-etched>etched</a> i thought i had a high chance - the head ops guy found me on linkedin, i went to their recruiting events, i showed off my knowledge on gpus and datacenters. i had a really great convo w carter, who worked at character and was interested in my writing. throughout my convos the shape of the role morphed - from pure ops to something hyperscaler-facing - however the interview with the cto was extremely thorough - he grilled me on the contrary research piece on inference platforms that i mentioned in my prev interview (trap!!), asked me ops questions (like how i would set up a process for tracking chips), and how i would set up business-related accounts (without using the microsoft suite). i flailed and knew five minutes in he could see right through me.</p><p>i documented my reflection from january to march <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/March-2025-Reflection rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/March-2025-Reflection>here</a>.</p><a href=#hypothesis-2-deployment-strategist><h4 id=hypothesis-2-deployment-strategist><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>hypothesis 2: deployment strategist</h4></a><p>forward-deployed roles were trending, and i thought it could be a good application of my intution for customers and my scrappy prototyping skills.</p><p>i went through the entire interview process with <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/peregrine-interviews rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/peregrine-interviews>peregrine</a>, which i picked bc cat z had switched over there. every convo w the team members was highly engaging - esp the final boss, akash, who was a killer - but i was always sus about their market position of building tech for law enforcement. i realized that the team, role, and stage could all be the fit, but the actual nature of the work mattered a lot.</p><p>i also got a cold email from a contractor for <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/windsurf rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/windsurf>windsurf</a>, which had a extremely compelling deployed role (based in sf/austin) that paid well at a hot company. however i didn&rsquo;t pass the first &ldquo;technical&rdquo;, probably due to a mismatch in background. which is ok bc windsurf ended up getting acquired anyways!</p><a href=#hypothesis-3-pmtpm><h4 id=hypothesis-3-pmtpm><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>hypothesis 3: pm/tpm</h4></a><p>ah, back to square one: (t)pm. having pursued these adjacent roles to their final ends, i picked up a couple of product-leaning interviews.</p><p>the most notable is scale, where a recruiter reached out about their gen ai tpm role. i thought it was a perfect fit: based in nyc, ai-related, fast-paced company. the culture was always a glaring red flag, however - they constantly emphasized that they work 60-70 hours and that people frequently cycle through managers. i thought my manager <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/john-call rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/john-call>j solitario</a> was a killer - but he was pretty nonresponsive via email. i studied hard for the technicals (live spreadsheet test, product case) and had the most stressful <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/scale-negotiation rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/scale-negotiation>negotiation</a> experience with jessica. this process coincided with my early promotion at microsoft, so i was also at odds on whether i should jump early and miss my promo (and insult the people who promoted me). in the end i decided to sign the offer in hopes of jumping to an even sicker startup next.</p><p>unfortunately (or rather fortunately) scale got tied up in an acqui-hire for alexandr wang, and the <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/bull-bear-case rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/bull-bear-case>future of the company</a> was highly up in the air. <em>specifically</em> for my division, which provided data labelling for the labs. i had a candid chat with j who said he&rsquo;d shift towards defense work, and i decided to [<a class="internal-link broken">pass on the offer</a>.</p><p>by now it&rsquo;s june & the motion of time definitely threw me in a turmoil, as i hyped myself up to finally leave microsoft. i was upset that id have to waste time. the roi of not working at a startup pained me.</p><a href=#hypothesis-4-the-vc-route><h3 id=hypothesis-4-the-vc-route><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>hypothesis 4: the vc route</h3></a><p>i leaned on vcs to connect me to people that they had known. by chance i went to a soma event where i met nikhita, who focused on ai infra and had connections throughout nyc. thanks to her i chatted with normal computing (though there weren&rsquo;t any immediate roles and the founder gave me generic career advice) as well as openrouter (for which there was an epic product role, and despite chatting w the cto they decided i was too early to be their first product hire. fair!)</p><p>i reconnected with tom, who i had previously a three way convo with him and justin. <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/7-11-25-tom-convo rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/7-11-25-tom-convo>this time</a>, i was much more straight to the point: i want to leave microsoft pm asap. he was extremely generous with finding people for me to chat with, and encouraged me to lean into the finance options of nyc. i talked to a s&amp;o person at spade (for whom i didn&rsquo;t have good questions and we didn&rsquo;t rlly connect), the cto at <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/tiger-global rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/tiger-global>tiger global</a> (who saw past my lack of finance knowledge immediately, and advised me to learn the Proper Nouns of an industry). the most promising was with his wife, <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/7-25-elsie-chat rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/7-25-elsie-chat>elsie</a>, for product management at two sigma. i was hopeful about this: trading firms were prestigious but recruited from big tech, and there was application of my hpc work into their own high-frequency trading. i had a couple of <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/two-sigma-pm-interviews rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/two-sigma-pm-interviews>interviews</a> (all white dudes) with varying successes (one asked me how i would build a system to track ticker systems for input data - i frankly stumbled so hard). in the end they relayed they were pausing the search and resuming in 2026.</p><p>i also chatted with a lady from greylock with whom i actioned on scheduling on her calendar. she was caught off guard but appreciated my balls, and tried to find things for me but nothing really hit.</p><p>the talent person from contrary research also suggested roles within network - deployment at chalk and pm at moment - but for both i never got an actual interview.</p><a href=#hypothesis-5-the-final-bosses><h3 id=hypothesis-5-the-final-bosses><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>hypothesis 5: the final bosses</h3></a><p>during my initial recruiting phase, i made a list of inference platforms and reached out to their pms - fireworks, baseten, modal, together. only one guy responded: ray thai, ex-stanford/google pm at fireworks. he was nice enough to hop on a call with me and while there weren&rsquo;t open roles, he later reached out in july.</p><p>the forward deployed pm role at <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/fireworks-pm-role rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/fireworks-pm-role>fireworks</a> felt like the dream opportunity. series c sequioa startup, within the ai infra/inference space, with a <em>product role</em> !! and it was listed for new york. i worked extremely hard for the interview process bc i knew there was only one role - i prepped intensely for the <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/fireworks-product-sense rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/fireworks-product-sense>product sense interview</a> with dhruv, the take home agent <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/fireworks-case-walkthru rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/fireworks-case-walkthru>case</a> with pranay, the <a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/fireworks-onsite-panel rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/fireworks-onsite-panel>fireworks onsite panel</a> with chao yu / lin / ray thai. in the end, however, the role was switched from remote-friendly to sf-only.</p><p>i was devastated. throughout this entire game i had assumed only nyc options, and moving to sf wasn&rsquo;t even on my radar. was i ready to make a switch for this startup? i tried really hard to get them to offer a remote friendly offer, but they wouldn&rsquo;t budge.</p><p>when i was contemplating whether or not to move i also got a crash course in nyc opportunities with mahesh. i got shortcutted into the sierra ai strategist pipeline, and this was a company that definitely stood out against the rest - the narrative is strong, every person was extremely competent, and they just act with craft and taste. unfortunately i wasn&rsquo;t super compelled towards the idea of building ai agents.</p><p>mid-way through fireworks, i also got a cold email from <em>openai</em>. back then this was huge - i assumed (rightfully so) that i was underqualified for all the roles, technical-bg and tenure wise. i was extremely intimidated by their team, having worked with them, and their technical bar.</p><p>it really came down to openai vs sierra.</p><p>there were many people who supported me the past year. first and foremost, nitin was an absolute anchor, from finding startups for me to talk to, hitting up old friends for favors, coaching me through interviews, and putting up with my cyclical overthinking when it came to decision time. second, justin. it&rsquo;s rare to find friends who wish to actively shape and add to your main quests, and all i know about the startup game comes from him. from the high-level - strategy / philosophy of a role, evaluating the stages of a company, how to position myself - to the nitty gritty - how to write a good cold email <em>without</em> AI!</p><a href=#honorable-mentions><h3 id=honorable-mentions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>honorable mentions</h3></a><p>mental dump of other convos</p><ul><li>harvey<ul><li>s&amp;o girl</li><li><a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/Varun-Harvey-Call rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/Varun-Harvey-Call>varun</a></li></ul></li><li>dynamo ml<ul><li>cold emailed ex microsoft girl shaily</li><li><a href=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/Coffee-Chat-Archana rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/my-digital-garden/my-vault/content/Coffee-Chat-Archana>Coffee Chat Archana</a>
