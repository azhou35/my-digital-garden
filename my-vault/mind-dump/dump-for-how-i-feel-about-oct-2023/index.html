decisions, getting in and out of breakups. you see love around you and you wish you could feel the same way. you know it exists. remember takeways from friends: when you lose something you gain something. you dont owe anyone a relationship. forgive yourself, because you know how you lose yourself in a relationship. you also know what feels right and love should come easily to you. annie, you are always learning and practicing how to stand up for yourself. from telling boys to wear cond* ms to telling them upfront your expectations out of a relationship , do not waver or let them convince you otherwise.</p></li><li><p>dear curtis,</p></li><li><p>i wish so much love for you. i hurt you, and i gave up on you, and i also tried so hard with you. i gave myself every moment to delay decision with you. and i know you would have worked with me. you met me at the wrong time. i went into it wanting you to pass in and out of my life. and i am so sad bc i know you would work so hard to build something beautiful together but it requires an effort that i dont want to commit to right now. i miss you & love you most on the verge of missing you, but nothing to that level when i am with you.</p></li></ul><p>nothing triggers me more than being unable to communicate my feelings
— trying to explain how i feel to my mom in chinese bout my break up and being unable to find words
— trying to explain to eric my feelings and getting shut down
— trying to explain to curtis my boundaries and getting convinced
