our goal provide researchers with stable and predictable access to compute esp for long-running jobs quota assignments to reflect what is actually reliably available in a cluster over time the problem we want to solve: today clusters appear to have enough quota but the # of healthy nodes can vary from week to week teams have been allocated more quota than healthy gpus to back it silent failure modes visibility problesm for why they have quota but cant use it tooling implementation in the future we want to introduce a buffer-based quota policy tied to cluster healthy where zoku quota will automatically align to healthy node count when cluster has more healthy nodes than SLA buffer, excess capacity flows into flx pool this is not removing compute from teams since everything is divertede to flex explanation of the tools / knobs jos to explain flex compute the ask from rpms socialize the shift to stable backng capacity how to treat flex as real compute will start with clusters with healthy headroom to build confidence log</description></item><item><title>2025-11-06</title><link>https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/my-vault/2025-11-06/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/my-vault/2025-11-06/</guid><description>message Joel day 1 five in one cluster unless

Storage Primer Issues come in four ways:
Persistent storage object storage (S3 / Blob) / network file systems (NFS / Lustre / GPFS ) / bloc storage (PD, EBS, local SSD) / node-local NVMe Data ingestion Check point downloads / datasets shards / containers images / model weights Runtime i / o mmap / read() / page cache / PCIe DMA / GPU memory copies GPU execution HBM / SRAM / Compute SRAM is the tiny whiteboard next to the compute - used for L1/L2 Caches no refresh however it has huge area cost on the chip HBM isued for model weights , kv cache, insane bandwidth its a big storage next to gpu many GPU utilization problems are actually memory hierarchy problems GPUs are uniquely sensitive to storage - CPUs tolerate slowness bc &amp;ldquo;CPU threads block / OS scheduler hides latency - you get slow, but it still works&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>groq</title><link>https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/my-vault/groq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/my-vault/groq/</guid><description>![[Pasted image 20251225150617.png]]</description></item><item><title>gym membership</title><link>https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/my-vault/gym-membership/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://azhou35.github.io/my-digital-garden/my-vault/gym-membership/</guid><description>wellhub
