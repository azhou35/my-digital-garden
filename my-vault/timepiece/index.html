-> fake watches</p><p>how do you build a less anxious relationship with time?</p><p>there’s nothing more performative than a watch on a girl who can’t tell time.</p><p>i don&rsquo;t mean literally, though i struggle to interpret the tiny hands on the glass circle. i mean every time before an event, there is a solid 30 minutes i stare at the clock, in trepidation of the activity to come. i am slave to to time, tethered to an internal metronome that threatens bad things to come if i arrive even a minute late.</p><p>my mind keeps returning to the vision of a vintage gold watch, thanks to a tik tok algorithm force-feeding me images of stylish girls flashing gold on their wrists. six-minutes walk from canal station. i avoid the tourists flooding chinatown at the first hint of warmth, making my way to mike’s watches.</p><p>the shop is empty save for the balding asian man at the counter, tinkering with miniature screwdrivers. it takes me a few minutes to fumble together my crinkled dollar bills as i gather the courage to practice my creaky mandarin. <em>手表</em>? i manage, before he cuts me off in english: “which one you want?”</p><p>cheeks flushed, i shake my head wordlessly and defer my gaze to the merchandise. i keep myself busy rifling through watches, and take a couple to compare in the the mirror.</p><p>which one fits better? an ex obsessed with marks of luxury had once dragged me from one watch store to another, pursuing some patek philippe pipe-dream. i tried to rack my brain for what the man from <em>watches of switzerland</em> had said all those years ago &ndash; the watch face should be halfway the size of the wrist? no, a third?</p><p>a couple of old chinese men pull up — locals, no doubt — and mike of mike’s watches starts bantering with them in <em>cantonese</em>. my temporary gall to communicate has escaped me, but i extend my hand and allow him to fasten a watch onto my wrist. it’s a beautiful thing, golden framed bezel and faux diamonds glittering in the store light.</p><p>i just need a quick fix, i tell myself as i walk out of the shop with a wrist that glimmers in the sunlight. i don’t need something that lasts.</p><hr><p>i can recall certain turning points in my life when my perception of time notably shifted. there are certain turning points of life when your perception of time shifts. the numbness in the day after you graduate college. the gossamer stretch just before falling in love. mom says things shift after you have children, with a pointed look at me.</p><p>in the break of summer heat, i feel restless. the <em>dog days</em>, or so they say. i am disatisfied with my job out of college and feel like i am pacing in one place, watching the days unspool like a piece of thread. i have so much free time that i pack with friend catch-ups, and i go from one cafe to a restaurant to a wine bar to another. the common theme is that i &ldquo;gotta be patient,&rdquo; as mentors and friends alike try to remind me.</p><p>time is an elusive thing that is constantly escaping my grasp. like some koi fish escaping upstream against water flowing downwards. i’m hasty, as ever, trying to speedwalk my way through chinatown, constantly bumping into traffic jams behind the slow-moving grandmas dragging suitcases across the jagged streets. i am running late to nothing, but i am still impatient.</p><p>my parents pass down advice the way that others pass down fancy watches. my dad loves to remind me that <em>to be on time is to be late</em>, while mom needlessly reminds me to slow down.</p><p>she keeps track of my life on a vintage red calendar—the kind you tear off, month by month. each page disappears into the trash. <em>annie visits home</em> in chicken scrawl on the 17th. <em>pick up jason from airport</em>.</p><p>my perception of time upturned when i realized how it passes at different rates for my parents, who have calculated the latter portion of their lives around me. there’s this notion that time accelerates as we age, as each year becomes a smaller fraction of our whole life. it’s why childhood feels endless and adulthood feels like a rapid hamster wheel. we’re moving through time at different tempos, and i can feel the gap widening.</p><p>[</p><p><img src=https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xdEb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd39f0352-6177-4dd1-8d64-957187fd28e7_1084x963.jpeg width=auto alt></p><p>](

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#footnote-1>1</a></em></p><p>i think back to the ancients and how they survived before our time machines. their sundials and circadian rhythms. all humans want to do is control time. all they can do is build something that lasts. is this not why the ancients built monuments and pyramids that would outpace their lifetime? is that not why we construct these artifacts that define time, our clocks and calendars, our feeble attempts to contain the inevitable.</p><p>it’s ironic that out of all things, it’s our time machines that are stuck in the past. but perhaps this is what <em>timeless</em> really means.</p><p>there is a ticking — from my wrist, from my chest. maybe it’s better that i don’t check my watch.
