## Standard Bio (Website/Professional)
Annie Zhou is a technical program manager at Microsoft working on AI infrastructure, though she's equally drawn to computational poetry and urban design. She explores the intersection of technology and aesthetics through writing, data visualization, and side projects that ask questions about how we move through cities and digital spaces.

Annie writes a newsletter about curated wandering—the practice of mindful exploration guided by curiosity rather than algorithm. Her interests span from European cafe culture to bike infrastructure, from solitude versus loneliness to what makes a good digital garden. She's an observer and documenter, always with a Fujifilm camera and journal in hand.

As an Asian American, she's exploring questions of identity and belonging across the cities she's loved: Seattle, Copenhagen, Shanghai, New York. She's training for the 2026 NYC Marathon and building community around books, design, and people who appreciate the art of noticing.

## Extended Bio (About Page)
I'm Annie Zhou, a technical program manager at Microsoft working on AI infrastructure and GPUs. But if I'm honest, I'm more passionate about computational poetry, data visualization, and the question of how technology can be used for aesthetic inquiry and critical thinking.

I'm interested in the spaces between things: technology and poetry, solitude and loneliness, urban design and human connection. I write a Substack newsletter (nzzuo.substack.com) exploring curated wandering—a practice of mindful exploration that follows curiosity rather than algorithms, that honors both conscious intentions and subconscious attractions.

My side projects live at the intersection of poetic computation and urban design. I'm drawn to data visualizations of books read and cities traveled, to scrolling stories about bike infrastructure, to redesigning Goodreads, to anything that helps us notice the patterns in how we move through physical and digital spaces.

I studied abroad in Copenhagen and have traveled through Prague, London, Paris, Shanghai, and Tokyo—always as a flâneur, always documenting. I'm obsessed with European cafes, Christopher Alexander's "Timeless Way of Building," and Kierkegaard's belief that we can "walk ourselves into our best thoughts."

As an Asian American, I'm grappling with questions of cultural identity and belonging. I'm learning to be comfortable with solitude. I'm training for the 2026 NYC Marathon. I'm building communities around books, design, and people who value the art of noticing.

I'm a self-described maximalist who believes in curated wandering, in building digital gardens, in using technology for critical thinking rather than passive consumption. I'm figuring out what problem I want to obsess over—and documenting the journey along the way.

**Currently:** Technical Program Manager at Microsoft | Based in NYC | Training for NYC Marathon 2026 | Building at the intersection of poetry and technology

**Interests:** Computational poetry, urban design, data visualization, coffee culture, people watching, digital gardens, community building, the art of noticing

**Tools:** Fujifilm camera, journals, way too many note-taking apps

## Poetic Bio (Creative/Personal)
I'm a wanderer with a technical degree and a poetic heart. By day, I wrangle AI infrastructure at Microsoft. By night (and honestly, also by day), I wonder about computational poetry, cities that invite curated wandering, and what happens when technology is used for aesthetic inquiry instead of optimization.

I document observations in a Substack, collect tokens of happiness in journals, and believe that the best thoughts come while walking. I'm training for marathons and building digital gardens. I'm an Asian American navigating belonging across continents, a maximalist learning to embrace solitude, a flâneur with a Fujifilm camera always ready.

My goal is simple and impossible: to notice everything, to build community everywhere, to find the poetry in data and the structure in wandering. To answer the question—what problem do I want to obsess over?—by following every thread of curiosity wherever it leads.

I'm here, at this moment in time, trying to capture light on European facades, patterns in urban mobility, and the feeling of being deliciously, intentionally alone in a city that loves you back.
