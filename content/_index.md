Welcome to my little corner of the Internet — a digital garden where I collect thoughts, writing, and ideas as they grow.

Feel free to wander around. You can start by browsing:

- **[Writing](/my-vault/content/)** — essays on solitude, design, coffee, and more
- **[Tech](/my-vault/tech/)** — notes from the world of infrastructure and computing
- **[Urbanism](/my-vault/urbanism/)** — thoughts on cities and spaces
- **[Poetic Phrases](/my-vault/poetic-phrases/)** — language that stuck with me
- **[Mind Dump](/my-vault/mind-dump/)** — raw, unfiltered thinking

Or press `Ctrl` + `k` to search for anything, and explore the graph to see how ideas connect.
