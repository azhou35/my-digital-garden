title: "do i want it or do i want people to know i have it?"

my impulse purchase of a $200 lamp started like most things: 
the other day i bought a noguchi lamp. because i couldnt forget its visage, this delicate paper lighthouse, how stubbornly it persisted on my pinterest board for *nyc apt inspiration*, its delicate form on a low-standing oval table, a warm glow that emits from within.

i don't really do much about this lamp, except show it off at gatherings and surrepitiously store it in the background of my zooms.

people are sharing their christmas lists on tik tok again. black friday pummels me with ads. 

success / prestige all assumes we are chasing something that other people would desire. infinite vs finite game. i transferred from an objectively good college to a questionably ok college for the brandname. 

there is no way of "winning" career 

desires are mimetic 

my experience in nyc is that i wanted to go to where all my friends where going to.

we buy things -> to say something about ourselves -> to try and be something/or someone
