### on seasons & becoming

the winter darkness stings deeper in february, a bone-chill that clutches in lemmas of stillness. it's lucky february's a short month, giving way to march's tentative warmth. you were told the day you were born, it was a rare 72 degree day in early march - your mother entering the hospital in a bright yellow jacket, both swollen and hopeful, ready to shed winter's weight.

"What they don't understand about birthdays and what they never tell you is that when you're eleven, you're also ten, and nine, and eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four, and three, and two and one." the years stack like geological layers, each birthday a new sediment of experience. sometimes when people ask my age i've said 22 with a sheepish grin - simultaneously wanting to be older and ageless. age-agnostic, perhaps, because i feel just as angsty and confused and unsettled as i did at eleven, and probably will at thirty.

i waste my youth in a terrible hurry to read all the books, see all the movies, listen to all the music - always satiated but always slightly hungry. *to be young is to be constantly on the precipice of perfection*, but the years slowly eat away at your margin for error until there is no margin left. mistakes transform from flaws of inexperience into flaws of character.

yet in this rush of becoming, i am delighted by humans above all. generosity of time is a quality you cannot optimize: the core of friendship is a mutual buy-in, an inherent social contract to invest in each other's stories. it's michelle making cookie batter the night before, shirling waking early to bake a flower-adorned cake, justin quietly clearing plates, gary capturing moments with his heavy-weight sony. four cameras of different fidelities preserving a single moment of joy.

when i look at emptiness all the coins inside me start rattling, restless. meaning-making functions as a daily wrestle with light - in moments of blinding brightness, you have no idea what shape your shadows will take. but around me, friends ground these moments in reality. their generosity of time reminds me that we're all just trying to make sense of our shadows together, watching winter melt into spring, year after year.

perhaps that is what growing up is: learning to find comfort in this cycle of seasons, in the way we carry all our past selves forward, in how we learn to give our time to others. the light is most golden just before the shadows fall, but even in darkness, we are never truly alone.
