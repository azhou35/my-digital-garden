# copenhagen as a city — memories and analysis


& look at that, my semester abroad in copenhagen came & went !! study abroad exceeded my expectations and I’m glad it was one of my final moments of college. instead of trying to tie together my experience in some deep prevailing theme, I want to document some highlights of my 4 months abroad :)  

The frictionless way to document my observations about Copenhagen is thru lists (inspired by Michelle !!) so here goes:

What I’ll miss about copenhagen:
* fdf
* THE PASTRIES.
* 

What I won’t miss but am grateful to have experienced:
* $8 lattes 
  * I went into Copenhagen fully aware of how $$ it was — but 

Color palette of copenhagen

Break copenhagen down into its elements & recurring patterns
From the outside, it’s sterile, it’s colorless, its reliable & pleasing to the eye. Its homogeneity: beautiful blonde blue eyed Danes.

But living there, I got to dive deep into the inner colors of copenhagen. 

A palette of Copenhagen Colors

feels like: 
- swirling orange wine

to all the cities I loved before

in honor of valentine’s day, i penned some love letters to my favorite cities I visited this year<3 I love these cities for their beauty, their vibes, & the people I had the good fortune of meeting there !! 

**copenhagen** 
amber orange hues fuel delirious thoughts in the wine bar in norreboro, a smattering of crusty sourdough and schmaltzy sardines voyeurs to our conversation. i fall in love with wine bars & cardamom buns, *al fresco* dining & biking, dipping into canals & sketching at museums. *I love living life* in copenhagen, a city so well-designed it seems minimalist. i cycle past throngs of sunbathers tantalizingly close to slipping into the canals; colorful Nyhavn buildings pulsing with yellow-orange to fiery-red earth hues; public squares lined with hot dog stands and commuters blurring into a stylish stream of trench coats and vibrant scarves.

**prague**
love blossoms in warm-hued embraces on park benches, atop ledges, in cafes. “I love love,” my friend proclaims—we observe silent conversations and fill in the blanks. it is fall and we watch the people of Prague fall like tender leaves, spiraling together. two heads tilted towards each other in front of the arriving tram; fingers interlocked on a stroll past Charles bridge; duos upon duos watching the sun dip into the horizon of Letna Park. we huff and puff our way up Prague Castle, rewarded by a view of rust-red rooftops peppered with copper green spires. the city opens itself up to us, our prying eyes & incessant cameras.

**london**
here, I learn to love myself, wanderer with no travel companion, a single entity deeply aware of the space she occupies. In lieu of conversation I turn to my fujifilm & journal to remind myself of the sound of my voice. i play-pretend a posh princess prance: marvel at statue dynamism in the Victoria & Albert museum, navigate wayward streets past Victorian grandeur, ambulate amongst Piccadilly Circus. once skeptical of London, I can’t help but love its resemblance to NYC, & I fantasize a life where I move here. i indulge in afternoon tea and strike up a friendship with another solo diner, and we grab dinner in soho. 

**seattle**
i fall in love with(in) seattle summers time and time again—how can I help it, when the daylight stretches past 9pm, a never-ending encore? when the sky explodes into a melange of brilliant pinks & oranges & reds? emerald city, aptly named—an abundance of trees smooth into emerald green, against lakes that sparkle in the sunlight. the berries abound on burke-gilman trail & I am greedy, puncture their young skin before they fully ripen.

**los angeles** 
chasing sunsets and city views, new beginnings and rehashed endings. we saw lights of fallen angels beneath us and fancied ourselves god. in summer the city  wonder if 

**new york city**
on my eighth visit to nyc in a 15 week semester, I realized: this is where I want to be. post-omakase, my friends & I duck into an alley to chow down on fried oreos popping with grease. the dichotomy is real, the ridiculousness cannot be overlooked. but i’ve spent too long as a satellite to nyc orbit, promising myself that I would move there *someday*. I love the feeling of being part of something bigger than myself, being swept away in a sea of fast walkers & smooth talkers. a friend once warned: get too close to a trophy and you watch the gold rub off on your hands.

**Paris**
city of love, it claims and begets love. i reunited with an old 


blue and orange 
feels like: 
-the bikers in the opposite lane blur into a sea of blue overcoats and stylish boots 
-sharp edges cut against pollutionless sky




Tokyo 
hyperpop irl. neon red signs and brightness
