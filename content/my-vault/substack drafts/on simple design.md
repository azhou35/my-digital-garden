“Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never ­being satisfied.”

-- interesting how theyre voted for the "happiest" but their notion of "happiness" is more like satisfied
ppl have lower expectations & lower grind culture so less of the hedonic treadmill
=> is this good or bad?
finland is"happiest" but w most suicides
question: what is my central goal in life? 
-> obv not just job and career upleveling bc then i would focus more on skills
-> something more creative & making soemthing on my own and leading 
-> but what is stopping me from this pursuit?
