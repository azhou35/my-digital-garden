Unlearning Sinophobia

Internalizing self hatred for my culture

sunlight was nowhere to be seen the first week I was at Shanghai. Instead, a thick fog settled, made a home of the city, a constant [reminder of its air pollution problem](https://aqicn.org/city/shanghai/).  even my mom would ask random locals — *when did it get this bad?*

during my trip to china, I was awash in a hazy daze — days blurred into each other as I followed a routine of going to the gym, walking to Aldi’s, and yearning for interactions with peers. maybe it was the language barrier testing my elementary-level Chinese at the coffee shop; or the persistent sting of cigarette smoke in taxi cabs; or the very literal air pollution wherever I walked—but I felt like I was living life with smoke over my eyes. 

I had nascent dreams to make *something* meaningful when I went back to china—my first time back since middle school, I was now educated with some understanding of Asian American [politics?]  I read *interior chinatown*. I adore Li-Young Lee.  I devoured *The Poppy War* on the 10-hour flight. I wanted some inspiration for my own portfolio of identity-based work— a poem, perhaps, or a moving photo series.

Instead, I left with empty hands, more questions than answers, and a nagging sense of guilt. Adjusting to daily life was harder than expected. I grappled with inconsistent VPNs. I struggled to use my phone to buy eggs at 7-Eleven, as any form of payment had to be through a superapp like AliPay or WeChat. I failed to research shops to visit in my vicinity, squinting at tiny Chinese characters on the cluttered screen of MeiTuan (China’s equivalent to Yelp & Groupon). So much of daily life depended on mobile apps, and I failed to sign up for Temu—I couldn’t understand the Chinese prompts, and the site was so poorly designed I couldn’t rely on my own instincts with UI to navigate to the right page.

there’s also the more complicated friction I felt—that although I shared the same genes and features as passerby, I had a huge sign painted on my face:  *I don’t belong here*. I couldn’t help but compare my sense of belonging in Shanghai vs copenhagen; despite walking for a mile in the latter city without seeing another asian, I still felt more comfortable there. 

part of it is my fault. Actually, a big part of it is my fault. I neglected Chinese school growing up, demotivated by my heavy American accent constantly under fire by teachers. I read manga instead of manhua, watched anime instead of c-dramas. how could I expect my culture to welcome me with open arms, when I was the one who turned my cheek in the first place?

I felt uncomfortable watching cultural differences & wondered if I had developed some internal Sinophobia. I commented on the lack of personal space by locals, who were pushing in front of each other in line and crowding near me. i

This reflection seems largely negative, but there were definitely poetic moments I could wax praise for:

I dont even seem Chinese — my cover beguiles me the moment I open my mouth, and before that several people have asked if I’m Korean


Notes on Shanghai:


# ui diffs between us & china
#travel
* Chinese characters more complex -> parse data faster -> more clutter
* more app integrations
* we chat services a bunch of app 
* poor nature of app discovery


The app frenzy in china

Differences in Chinese language -> a lot of changes in app design
[Chinese Mobile App UI Trends](http://dangrover.com/blog/2014/12/01/chinese-mobile-app-ui-trends.html?curius=3,1593,1819)
- Chinese has diff inputs
- voice messages are popular 
- qr is popular
- intermediate badge
- us apps -> constellations of single use app
- phone and tokens > passwords
- online payments
- lots of apps to meet random ppl
- WeChat has a ppl nearby feature (like bereall)
- Baidu maps has a heat map

Shanghai has a bigger coffee shop culture that an I expect
