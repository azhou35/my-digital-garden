notes from my first solo trip in london

last week i hopped off of a call in tears [[mind dump/dump for how i feel about oct 2023]], and hopped onto a plane to london for my first solo trip. going into study abroad, i set out with a lofty goal to learn *how to be ok with being alone.* i've been lucky to envelop myself in consistent interaction with other people: i adore my suite mates with whom i cook weekly meals with, i've found friends to explore copenhagen with, and even fellow travel companions on weekends excursions to other countries. i've also been by myself for longer periods of time.

sitting alone on the metro, i reach for my camera & journal whenever a passing observation reaches escape velocity. these tools serve as extensions of myself, the solo traveler's form of comfort.

there's a fine line between solitude & loneliness, and i am in the exercise of exploring the former camp. solitude reminds me of henry david thoreau camping in the backwoods of new england — "I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude." it is a beautiful image, your thoughts enveloping you in a stable embrace, a promise that the world can spin itself into circles but you will always be there, at this moment in time. 

this distinction doesn't come easily. i am at my worst & my best when i am alone. some of my darkest moments were spent lying in bed, staring at my ceiling, wondering why i didn't have plans for the weekend, wringing my tongue dry with my unused voice. i feel hyperaware of myself when i wade through streets alone. loneliness manifests as a physical state, a stench that permeates the air and clings to my vulnerable skin. 

i have intentionally chosen to be alone. 

when asked my biggest fear as a child, i would immediately say being alone — but in wake of my pending transition into true adulthood, i'm trying to reorient this inevitable loneliness as something positive. as intentional *solitude* 

"used to think it was an introvert thing, but now i’m convinced that when you feel drained after a social event it’s bc you weren’t comfortable being yourself w the ppl you were with. it’s super energy-consuming to suppress a part of you or be anyone other than yourself.

i wouldn't call myself an introvert, but being alone holds a level of authenticity i don't have when i'm with others. no matter how comfortable or close i feel with another, i unintentionally don a mask in conversations—draw out my vowels, quicken or slow down my speaking pace, try to exaggerate my responses to seem funnier, smarter, more dramatic. there's an act of translation between my words in their rawest form and when they're revealed to the world. when i talk to myself there's no one to impress.

notes from my first solo trip in london

“and when nobody wakes you up in the morning, and when nobody waits for you at night, and when you can do whatever you want. what do you call it, freedom or loneliness?” -Charles Bukowski

I went on my first solo trip this October, hopping onto a last-minute trip to London. this was no small affair: as a kid, when people asked me what my biggest fear was, I would say being alone. this intangible state of being is something i’ve feared about my looming adulthood, so going into study abroad, i set out with a lofty goal to learn *how to be ok with being alone.* 

while i've been lucky to envelop myself in consistent interaction with other people—cooking weekly meals with suite mates, exploring copenhagen with friends, and even finding travel companions on weekends excursions to other countries—i’ve also experienced a subliminal loneliness, one that’s slunk in and out of my life like a sly cat. 

On an oddly sunny October morning, I found myself sitting alone on the Heathrow Express into inner London. Without the crutch of a companion, I’m viscerally aware of how I may seem to others, the space I take up in the patchwork cushion—ironic, isn’t it, how a solo person takes up more space in our eyeline compared to the duos we are accustomed to.

there's a fine line between solitude & loneliness, and i am in the exercise of exploring the former camp. solitude reminds me of henry david thoreau camping in the backwoods of new england — "I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude." it is a beautiful image, your thoughts enveloping you in a stable embrace, a promise that the world can spin itself into circles but you will always be there, at this moment in time.

Being alone forces me to focus on my immediate surroundings. This is great for my photography and journaling—when I passed by a building or a cool scene I would normally point out to a friend, I instead reached for my fujifilm and snapped a pic.
