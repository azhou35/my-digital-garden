Hey Tony - sorry to hear about the sickness, hope you feel better ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f642@2x.png)  
re: daily host drain: echoing Saagar's sentiments [here](https://openai-corpws.slack.com/archives/C09E7G3ULDD/p1761893275771509?thread_ts=1761852530.510759&cid=C09E7G3ULDD) that we should divert this effort from manually draining 50 nodes at a time into building an automation here. We should prioritize meeting about this and getting an ETA for a better process here before we continue with this maintenance work

our team is _extremely_ swamped right now bringing up new capacity and I cannot commit this amount of capacity-handholding for individual hosts for the next two weeks. I would love to commit that effort to automation instead because I am confident, on our end, we can fully plumb it through within days if we have the right signals



Are these maintenance events currently sent as OCI health signals?


Let's get the automation meeting ASAP or connect with the right folks to determine what we need
