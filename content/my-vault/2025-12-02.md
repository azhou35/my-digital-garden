- Apollo outlined several roadmap items related to performance and reliability, including stagger detection, already supported for other families, which uses heuristics to pinpoint nodes causing performance degradation in training jobs ([01:02:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.sja1bn9xtchv)). They also mentioned efforts on hang detection to identify stalled nodes in a training job, and failure or degradation prediction using telemetry data and internal training to forecast potential failures within a few hours ([01:03:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.v3hre7mssx0w)).
    
- Failure Prediction System Details and Integration with GKE Apollo clarified that the failure prediction model is trained using telemetry signals from all Google deployments, such as XID and networking data, without using customer proprietary information. The model uses signals like temperature and power spikes to predict XID occurrences, and they are optimizing between recall-based and decision-based models ([01:05:21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.e15o1h7erlb8)). They are integrating this prediction capability with GKE to enable "predictive scheduling," where GKE can select machines with a lower probability of failure for workloads ([01:04:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.r1zsokbk3mbr)) ([01:07:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.fhi8cmcmnj6d)).
    

Exposing Predictor Score and Usage Scenarios The prediction is presented as a score for all participating instances, rather than using a defined threshold, to avoid false positives ([01:08:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.alov6tc023wv)). Apollo noted that the time series metric is available at the instance level for custom monitoring, allowing users to run lower-priority workloads on lower-scored machines ([01:09:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZg6zpyzZ5lisN7IAl_xJdnnO7SyB7YiqszgT4yM5O0/edit?tab=t.k537sbojx0qz#heading=h.x1ro1p1jt0bj)). They are using GKE as a proof of concept to demonstrate how customers could leverage this raw data, and internal studies have shown performance improvements when prioritizing higher-scored nodes**
