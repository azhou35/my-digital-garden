title: "month-1 reflection"
---

feel good about the pace of work, happy getting some traction
definitely need to improve in terms of:
- comms and stakeholder management
	- how to improve 
big rocks i want to tackle
- maintenance ops & automations
	- how can we make maintenances less toilsome to schedule? 

i generally feel more satisified at work. a lot of my requests (e.g. building process for gcp maintenance, building new ui changes to zoku)

kenny shared this is a path to l5 - if i kill it with saagar and start picking up work for reza/networking

i liked kenny's vision for a platform for gpu compute - one where we reach parity across csp skus and we are able to enable an operational flow where for maintenance:
- we can schedule and trigger ops (cordon nodes) w a click of a button
- we can monitor and display results
what can i do to help openai be an ai cloud?
what are we missing compared to a normal hpc cloud?
we have the compute but this feels behnd:
- scheduling 
- maintenance ops
	- programmatic maintenance windows
	- cross-cloud consistency
	- clear SLOs / customer impact
	- fleet-wide maintenance spec
	- unifiied maintenance scheduler 
- operational safety rails
	- - “What happens when a cluster dips below SLA?”
	- “What happens when we need to drain 5k GPUs?”
	- “How do we do rolling rather than explosive maintenances?”
