1. how come u dont hate ai 
craft & devaluation of craft 
very tricky thing 
mechanization of craft
- either resist or elevate that craft
criticism is self-subverting 
why do you even value their opinion 
when the motion picture they thought of their machine as a scientific achievement
didnt realize this had ability to capture presence of actuality
possibility of being other places
- not interested in having ai write novels, create movies - uses are stupid - no more interesting than pointing a motion camera at a stage and playing that back
- fundamentally interested in what we can tell with only ai 
- equivalent of cinema
much like how cinema was a diff medium than play
ai is a new medium 

1. why are people upset about environmental impact
	1. we use this work for industrial farming
2. use ai to craft dreamlike experience

		2. engravers were put out of busines
	3. real disaplacement of human craft - why do we prefer heliograph 
	4. art of engraver is particularly constrained
		1. highest ideal is recreating someone elses vision 
		2. when you ask a machine to do a copy work - when the highest copy of the human ideal 
	5. any art form where the highest ideal is judged by how well you can copy something

3. copies / consciousness
	1. the uploading process does not work because its just a copy of u
	2. a copy is inherently worthless - not as worth as the original
	3. how do you know that the same person who wakes up is the same as the person who went to sleep yesterday
		1. are yo ujust a separate mortal being - continuity is a mere illusion 
		2. brain of theseus argument
		3. https://www.spencergreenberg.com/2017/07/brain-of-theseus-a-thought-experiment/
	4. we have models that can do amazing things
	5. people believe consciousness is more important than intelligence
	6. intelligence =/= consciousness
4. how do you transform the universe 
	1. dreaming something nad making something real 
	2. fantasy and making something real
	3. science fiction i the branch of fantasy w dreams
