At its core, signal detection theory involves the measurement of the difference between two distinct patterns. The first is called the “stimulus” when you’re talking about some type of living organism or the “signal” when you’re talking about a machine. The second pattern involves the random noise that distracts either a person or a machine’s ability to collect and process information.
