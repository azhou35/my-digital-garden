title: "dump for how i feel about oct 2023"
---

- remind urself that u r not the bad guy and that u were really not ready for a relationship
- remind urself that u will find love again !!! ur only 21 !!! so many pretty people around u still waiting for love & love found you even when you werent looking
- remind urself that u r ok with being alone and u dont miss talking with him, just the stability that if u cant find someone closer he will be there
- twinge of regret since i know curtis would be high performing and impressive to be around but also put myself first which is such a rare combo 
	- but also since day 1 i told myself he is not the last great guy i can meet 
	- and he couldnt provide for me the way that is fair to him bc i dont wnat him to do all that for me
- but i think the love i had for him was fleeting and short lived and couldnt sustain sm time apart
- standards for next guy: (ITS POSSIBLE)
	- motivated
		- by something else other than money
		- (either creative or startup)
	- attractive
	- romantic & treats me well 
	- outgoing 
	- mature & kind
	- **in the same location as me or will be in the same location**
	- (even if it's not possible, if curtis rlly were the one, i would find my way back to him someday. maybe he moves to nyc on his own accord for the startup scene. who knows)
- tradeoff between spending time in berkeley vs cornell
	- so ready to never go back to cornell and just go to berkeley
- from tiff: dating ldr is hard os so hard 
- from michael: ldr is sooo hard and its a tradeoff between hanging out w his gf and meeting ppl in seattle 
	- i need/want to meet ppl in nyc and i do that on weekends
	- visiting seattle: 6 hour flight + 3 hours spent in airplane + jet lag (x2)
	- calling frequently: 3 hour time diff  — so hard bc we would call when he would be burnt out 
- its not that curtis checked all the boxes he missed the most important one: circumstance
- REMIND THAT LOVE IS IN ABUNDANCE !!! YOU WERE WHOLE BEFORE YOU MET CURTIS, YOU WILL BE WHOLE AFTERWARDS.
- REMIND YOURSELF YOU COULD NEVER SHAKE OFF THE CIRCUMSTANCES: THE TIMING RIGHT AFTER ERIC, THE INSTABILITY IN UR LIFE, THE FACT U COULDNT GRASP THE LOGISTICS WELL ENOUGH. 
- REMIND URSELF THAT DURING UR RELATIONSHIP U DIDNT LIKE HIM AS MUCH AS HE LIKED U. U LIKED HOW MUCH HE LIKED YOU. 
- REMIND URSELF U ALWAYS LIKED THE IDEA OF HIM MORE THAN U ACTUALLY *LOVED* HIM. THE GUT FEELING THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WAS ALWAYS THERE. THE GUT FEELING OF U COMPARING HIM TO ERIC WAS ALWAYS THERE. 
- REMIND URSELF U R NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP RN. U COMMITTED TO BEING SINGLE IN STUDY ABROAD AND BEFORE GOING INTO NYC. AND ITS OK UR NOT GOING INTO NYC W THE NEED TO CALL W SOMEONE.
- the thing is curtis would be worth it IF i had genuine feelings for him && the entire summer i was battling with the struggle that i knew he was perf on paper but not perf for me in that moment. 
	- and i cannot separate him from the fact that i was not sure about our future ever 
- and thats the thing i knew throughout the summer, and even at the end of the summer i wanted to give curtis a chance. if curtis is rlly meant to be mine i let him go. but chances are he is not the one
- remind yourself what katherine said: most ppl do not take on this ldr unless theyre sure 
- relistened to my call w katherine where i said he asked if i would regret this 
- from lydia: its not right person wrong time cuz if it was the right person itd be the right time

10.24
- rn i feel like im mourning & processing the IDEA of curtis in the FUTURE, and mourning the IDEA of eric in the PAST 
- cant help feel like i traded the "negligible" angst /tiredness of traveling (something i can control) in exchange for the primordial angst of not finding the right person in the future aka the risk that i wont find someone like curtis for a while 
	- could have waited the long game and wait for curtis to move to nyc as he honestly seemed committed to do but also a promise is sooo hard to rely on and i would be forcing myself to like him enough to want to visit him in the meantime 
- i wonder: did i make a snap decision? did i process my anxiety and angst long enough? should i have asked for time & space instead? 
	- but if this angst came up so early on (and was there from the present) i couldnt sustain my delusion until we finally moved to the same city again 
- part of me is like: if its meant to be we will find our way back to each other again
	- the other part: i say this about every ex ASHDIOSHDIOASDO and then i move on. not fair for either of us to hope for this as an ideal case!! 
- ive never felt someone like me the same way curtis did for me before. BUT ive liked prev ppl more than i liked curtis. && its very valid & fair to want to be w someone who we both like each other a decent amount. otherwise itd be hard to sustain a long term relationship where im always unsure. 
- live w abundance mindset: there willl be many ppl i meet who are like curtis who will treat me well and right and i will be at a place to accept their love 
	- but also its natural that im still going back adn forth about my decision atm !! im human !! im getting ahead of myself and thinking too far into the future


10/25/23
* had a dream and a bunch of feels where i want to reach out again and say i made a mistake and i want to try to fight thru long distance but it doesnt work 
	* my fear is that when im alone and not travelling i will feel rlly alone
* i wish i could have a happy medium !!! we would end up in the same city and i wouldnt have to ""fight'" for a relationship so early on 
* rlly fighting the delulu thought that "if he is truly the right person we'll find a way back together again" bc logistically he wouldnt have moved to nyc unless i showed commitment && i already stayed firm in my decision to give up on us :C
* i mean i feel like this indecision is a good sign of why i gave this relationship a shot!
* its crazy during the breakup process i didnt see a future for ourselves and now that im not thinking about the logistics im able to think about the what ifs rlly seriously 


- conclusion: me & all my friends are looking at the same situation and trying to make sense of it using our own prev experiences and biases and will come to diff conclusions 


10/26/23
- we're all confused in this life and making decisions that we'll never know if they're making mistakes or not!! 
- rn battling the problem of not wanting to be in a relationship rn BUT knowing i want to be cuffed eventually
	-not ready for relationship:
		not fully over what happened to me and eric 
		(comparing new people to him, good and bad, comparing the feel of others w the feel of being w him)
	-not willing to compromise on big things
	-not willing to put in the work
	-also still processing what happened with eric 
	-processing all the times i gave up segc / dti / ithathots community to spend more time w someone who didnt like me as much back
- - i want to be cuffed EVENTUALLY
	- not first year in nyc necessarily
	- but would be nice to meet someone whos a good fit in the same city

10.26.23
rn my mindset has changed to 
"i want to get back together eventually"
-> even hto i KNOWWW this is SOOO toxic

- curtis said: 
	- once i close this door its closed forever
	- i half opened this door for you 
	- i dont think you meant to close this door
	- to reject and close the door again is not worth it
	- he knows that i didnt return as much as i could back to him

i feel all of this so hard :((( i don't think i ever had dumpers remorse exactly cuz i think i always knew deep down that ethan and i weren't right for each other but i definitely felt the same anxieties about not being able to find someone who would love me again/ someone who is "as good" etc. and just fear of being lonely

but there's a difference between being with someone cuz ur afraid of being alone and being with someone cuz you actually love them :(( i feel like there are a lot a lot of couples and people who are just together because they don't want to be alone/ know how to be alone, but i feel like in the long run that's just setting yourself up to lose :(( because either you're just pushing off the self growth and work you'll eventually still need to do years down the line, or you'll end up resigning yourself to a mediocre relationship for the rest of your life :(((

dating post grad can def be rough, but i feel like when you meet someone that you know is right for you, it won't cause you all of this anguish and anxiety. like yes relationships take work, but also they shouldn't be like pulling teeth 24/7. like the right person will/ should make you feel safe and secure, not shaky and anxious

there's a reason or like lots and lots of reasons that you broke up w him including things that were out of your control like logistical things and so you should trust yourself and your decision!

LOV U U CAN DO IT
- 
hmmmm i agree i think ur definitely not an avoidant but i don't think this was u acting out of impulse necessarily, like from what you've said ifl you've had a lot of doubts throughout and it's so so valid of u to not wanna commit to something super long term rn

and being afraid to commit to a long term relationship w/someone after dating them for 2ish months in person really isn't being noncommittal at all either

ok sorry that was a very long response HAHAHAHHAHAHA

10.27
* ok this week i let myself indulge in some delusions but know this wont happen in the future 

10.30
* holy shit im deluding myself the fuck right now
* WHAT IF I HOP ON A FLIGHT TO BERKELEY IN THANKSGIVING AND BEG HIM TO TAKE ME BACK 
* i think the problem is that im a dismissive avoidant type person who once i take a solo trip/disance myself/feel the commitment of a relationship increasing i push away
* i have a hypersensitivity to body language from eric
* realization: i developed a fearful avoidant personality after eric 
	* randomly break up when commitment becomes too high 
	* honestly the only thing i regret is getting into a relationship knowing that there were so many factors against us 
* w will — when the commitment to each other got too big instead of setting boundaries i would just ghost / cut him out 

11.2.23:
* dear annie: 
* you have been through so much in the past 2 years—transferring between colleges, doubting yourself, regretting your decisions, getting in and out of breakups. you see love around you and you wish you could feel the same way. you know it exists. remember takeways from friends: when you lose something you gain something. you dont owe anyone a relationship. forgive yourself, because you know how you lose yourself in a relationship. you also know what feels right and love should come easily to you. annie, you are always learning and practicing how to stand up for yourself. from telling boys to wear cond* ms to telling them upfront your expectations out of a relationship , do not waver or let them convince you otherwise. 

* dear curtis,
* i wish so much love for you. i hurt you, and i gave up on you, and i also tried so hard with you. i gave myself every moment to delay decision with you. and i know you would have worked with me. you met me at the wrong time. i went into it wanting you to pass in and out of my life. and i am so sad bc i know you would work so hard to build something beautiful together but it requires an effort that i dont want to commit to right now. i miss you & love you most on the verge of missing you, but nothing to that level when i am with you. 

nothing triggers me more than being unable to communicate my feelings
— trying to explain how i feel to my mom in chinese bout my break up and being unable to find words 
— trying to explain to eric my feelings and getting shut down
— trying to explain to curtis my boundaries and getting convinced 
i do not dream of labor 

google search results:
"how do i get over breaking up with my bf because we would we long distance for 2 years and i dont see this going anywhere but he was such a good guy"

11/11/23
* finally (it better be) settling my feelings and what if's to rest with curtis
* reached out for ONE MORE CALL bc i kept feeling like i made the wrong decision
* i think we fundamentally are soo diff hes a self proclaimed workaholic (accurate) and i rlly value my wlb 
* and when i was honest and vulnerable that i get anxious and feel like i was a fearful avoidant who like ran away when things got serious and asked to get back together he says as much as he wants to hes gonna say know bc 
	* 1) he is not in a good place to be in a relaitonship rn, hes super busy (i know if we stayed together he would try to balance it both but he would be mia during the weekdays and only b able to talk on weekends)
		* generally hes moving at a pace where he rlly wants to work 
		* and i think as much as im attraced to a workaholic it means its hard to build a future togetehr
		* he also would be prioritizing career and wont move to nyc unless it makes sense w an in person role, and i dont think that chance would come until 2+ years, and maintaining a LDR on top of that is unsustainable 
	* 2) i ran at the first sign of conflict / trouble in the relationship and yeah thats on me tbh i ant rlly argue against that lOL
		* i mean i already conceded i dont thnk im at a good palce to be in a relationship 
		* i only reaffirmed that w what i said
		* for us to build a relationship w me not 100% convinced 
* lasting serotonin of being able to talk to him one more time but I KNOW its so bad for the both of us
* i dont rlly care about having an "impressive bf" as much as a bf who i liek and lieks me
* icks:
	* the picture of him at halloween is kinda cray LMAOOO 
	* his hands still abnormally small
	* face still abrnomally small over cam
	* def pushed my boundaries in a way i wasnt comfy w 
	* workaholic is a little TOO intense, i def felt bad about taking up his time since i know his hours were limited
