### chap 1: the way 
* search for those moments and situations when we are most alive 
* certain patterns and events — living patterns— self maintaining — building into nature

* gate: generated y the ordinary actions of the people 

* the way — thousands of creative act
* fundamental human instinct to bring something that is part of then world

### chap 2: “The quality without a name”
* “it is never twice the same, bc it always takes its shape from the particular place in which it occurs”
  * reminds me of how during urban sketching, teacher said your sketches of the tree will never be the same, bc u are in that position looking at the shadows on the ground at that particular time
* “it is a subtle kind of freedom from inner contradictions”
* not all humans are equally true to our inner nature => not all systems are true to their inner nature
* metaphor of bending trees — self maintaining bc wind is balanced when trees are bent
* whole <=> self-containment 
* what is comfort?
  * you put the tea where you can reach it but in a place where u can’t knock it over
* example: not so ez to build a table for birds — bards have their own laws — need to understand the forces guiding them in the behavior
* possible to make a thing thet reflects ur personality
* quality can be described as “eternal”

### chap 3: being alive
* man is free then you see him w a certain smile and u know he is himself
* freedom/passion comes when we let go (its giving the matrix vibes)
  * we fear letting go , always bottled up
* *Ikiru — to live — describes it in the life of an old man *
* freedom when our inner forces are resolved
* identify buildings/towns when they have *unnamed quality* asking if they are like us when we are free

### chap 4: patterns in events

* describe Barcelona
* social events but ALSO events like sunshine shining on the windowsill, wind blowing in the grass
  * **cph examples:** sun shining through our ceiling to floor windows every night, children riding back home with their parents, clarissa cheffing up in the kitchen
  * => character of the environment 
* if you could choose between including water in a building : reflecting pool outside room vs stream outside ur room
  * stream > pool bc it affects experience of the building (think sound of the stream) 
* events shape the life of a town — esp recurring events
  * e.g. field given char by germination of grass seed, blowing wind, flowering of the grass
  * each person has their own patterns too


### chap5 :
* urban regions = defined by certain patterns of relationships among its elements, *not the elemnts themsleves
* *
