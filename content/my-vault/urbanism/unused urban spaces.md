# unused urban spaces
#urbanism
* some plazas attract a lot of ppl in nyc — most dont
* some are only used for walking across
* most ppl who use plazas are young office workers from nearby 
* plazas change way of life
  * best used plazas are sociable places
  * higher than average proportion of women in most used place
    * women going is good signal
* ppl gravitate towards lots of ppl
* ppl dont rlly choose to stand in the middle of a large place
  * preference for pillars
* movement thru space
* patterns not specific to nyc — based on other societies
* jan gehl’s study of self-congestion — mapped patterns similar here
* "Contrary to 'common sense' expectations," Ciolek notes, "the great majority of people were found to select their sites for social interaction right on or very close to the traffic lines intersecting the plaza. Relatively few people formed their gatherings away from the spaces used for navigation

Ideal streets: one where street and park is hard to see where one ends and begins 
Parks stimulates impulse use
- parks shouldn’t be too high or too low 
- ppl are scared for homeless ppl in cities
triangulation: external stimulus provides a linkage between people and promote strangers to talk as if they’re not
Sculptures have social effects
