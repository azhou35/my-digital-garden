title: "manifesting community"

#deep #urbanism 

* I’ve been searching for community for years
* how do we build community? Online? In person ? 
* my goal is always to find community in wherever I am 
* why are discord groups / reddit groups not a great place for community? 
* what entails a good community?
  * shared space / air (ppl u see on the regular, in classes, etc) 
    * -> in college ive seen thats not enough, there needs to be some compatibility beyond shared classes
* do I seek a new community when I get bored of people?
  * how do I prevent myself from running when im bored of people

Moments I felt community:
* discord server w the owo ppl 
* making food w suite mates in copenhagen
* making food w ithathots
* 

Goals:
* build “community” of fellow product managers 
  * besides ppl who are interviewing, just ppl generally interested in knowing each other and uplifting each other’s career
  * find pm-based groups in nyc 
* “community” of aapi groups
  * volunteering? Save china town? 
* community of ppl who like books
  * you & me books author events 
  * reflection: I’ve been going to these events alone, cuz sometimes I bring a date LOL and they dont enjoy it </3 

Manifestations:
* I want to be friends with people who like yu&me books

thinking about [[urbanism/timeless way of building|timeless way of building]] , cities come alive from recurring patterns, both small and big.
