The flâneur's path appears random but is guided by curiosity and attraction. This describes a middle path between structured exploration and pure chance—a mindful wandering that follows intuitive pulls while maintaining awareness.

## As Creative Practice
- Not algorithmic recommendation nor aimless scrolling
- Following threads of interest across seemingly unrelated domains
- Collecting "nuggets" that resonate without immediate purpose
- The first stage of sculpting—gathering material before refined creation

## Examples
- Walking through unfamiliar neighborhoods with attentive eyes
- Cross-platform exploration (Pinterest → academic articles → poetry)
- Reading outside your discipline but guided by questions
- Museum visits where you follow what draws your eye rather than the suggested route

## Connection to Authentic Mimesis
Curated wandering acknowledges influence while preserving agency. You aren't isolated from culture's currents, but you navigate them according to internal curiosity rather than external prescription.

This practice honors both conscious intentions and subconscious attractions—neither passive consumption nor rigid control, but a dialogue between self and world.
