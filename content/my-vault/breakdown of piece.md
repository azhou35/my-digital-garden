thesis: an interesting life begins when you stop chasing novelty and start following what compels you


intro: personal narrative
I. theory on struggle & clear desire
II. funny anecdote / theory on boredom
III. example of famous person / theory 
the turn
addendum: call to action

So I ask you, what are the things that compel you, over and over again? And why are you not pursuing it? What are your hesitations and your fears? It might be hard, but you were made to do hard things. You tolerate pain for a job that bores you (perhaps the ultimate pain), the least you could do is tolerate pain for your own pursuits.

> personal anecdote → stat + question → poetic infra explain → fieldwork stories → theory frame → a few sharp tensions → “what future do I want instead?”
