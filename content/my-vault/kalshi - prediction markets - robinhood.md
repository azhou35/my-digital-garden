**robinhood**
- makes money just from arbitrage between citadel and the avg person 

fintech companies can add new bells and whistles but at the end of the day these apps boil down to a slow machine.

now around the dinner table the adults give us investing advice. 
it hurts people all the same. my uncle lost his money day trading in china. 

the thing about risk-based games is that they capitalize on the people down on their luck. 
e.g. chinese casinos in atlantic city. 
even when you think you are outsmarting them you are losing in the end. 
technically democratic because everything gets access.

these this idea of finite vs infinite games and this is one infinite game.
- Casinos pretend to be finite—_hit the jackpot and walk away_—but are engineered to be infinite. You’re not supposed to beat the house; you’re supposed to come back next weekend.
- you may win the battle but lose the war 
house edge
- information asymmetry/arbitrage
	- platform gets paid on every activity
