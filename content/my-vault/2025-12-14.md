end of a good trip to miami 
feeling strange beause of the conversation of class & income w three friends who have been raised in families with good wealth 
j is a classic archetype of someone hwo chooses to study the humanities and go into academic bc they're post-economic which is a sense of privilege

my sister also operates with this mindset which upsets my parents bc they are not actually post economic 

airplane thoughts
i didnt realize real estate is not actually a good financial investment 
eg vinny thinks real estate is so important and a marker of financial success 
but actually this is just inherited from chinese cultures
my parents are very proud of their real estate but practically its not the best investment
at least not for us now 

question - is real estate still a good investment

i believe it to be incredible privilege to critique the system while participating in it - indulging in fashion, beauty, arts, all things that cost money. it's just a little out of touch. i also find it disapointing to noy vstr snouy vspiyslidm sy sll. 

if u got $10 mil tomorrow would you keep working?
most of my avg friends would say yes bc they would just travel and do side quests
m/j/j all say no bc of the love for the game and also they're kinda post-economic 


if you write with enough academic earnestness and intellectual curiosity 
there is a chance you will get famous for doing the work you love
wouldnt you rather get famous doing the work you love rather than repeating content you hate?


what i should do this week 
- [ ] get flighty 
- [ ] workout 
- [ ] buy flight tickets
