momentum mori
	- **this should be my 2025 piece**
	- i did things bc i could
		- i hosted that photo gallery, reached out to that chef, organized regular writing clubs and made it a *thing*
	- and i was relentless about job search. cold-dm'ed endlessly into a job. 
	- I’m terrified of slowing down because I don’t know who I’ll be when the momentum stops.
	- constantly optimizing for a local maxima
	- a friend who moved from the heart of manhattan to brooklyn comments how much she enjoys her local coffee shop, she can go to time and time again. 
	- when does novelty wear off -> compounding gains kick in?
		- Repeated traditions
	- la cabra multiple times 
	- motion > feeling
- absurdity of living
- repeated 

the way you live your days is the way you live your life
i fear how my

i changed jobs
i moved out of my childhood home
i moved cities
i hosted many events
friendship life cycle discussion w justin

winter:
- building momentum for social play and whismy
spring to summer
- reflection spikes on *stuckness, love, vocation, obsession*, interiority 
fall
- trying not to drift
dec 
- sentimental

on friendship 
- ppl retreat into relationships/work
- structure keeps ppl back to each other 
	- shared trips/standing hangs
- subtext: Do we still matter to each other when life gets big?
	- is the friendship still a priority or optional? will it survive big life tansitions 
- i ran a lot, but way less compared to last year
	- running became routine rather than social behavior 
	- i ran all 9 races to qualify for the nyc marathon 
		- some of my best performances in the freezing cold in february

2025 year in review

they say the way you live your days is the way you live your life. 

when i look back on a year, it's easy to recall the big shifts in my life - moving everything out of my childhood home, recruiting and switching jobs, moving cities. but it's the repeated habits, day in and day out, that have driven me forward. 

Running was a habit I picked up in 2022, as a way to clear my mind and move my body. This year, as remote work enabled my homebody tendencies it was the main practice that forced me outside. The NYRR 9+1 Program kept me accountable on the weekends - I had some of my fastest runs in the freezing Feb chill, as well as my more lack-luster performances during the summer. 

I had some of my fastest runs in the freezing Feb chill
Now I have to actually run the marathon in 2026 and lock in, so this year I better up the pace and increase the distance. 


the theme of the year was moving to analog. 
i tried film for the first time. i'm a trigger finger so it's hard to force myself to slow down, but you feel the physical mechanisms of the camera: the snap of the shutter, the internal whirring. 

As a kid i was a chronic doodler - i recently revived my midori notebook. curious by image + word, frightened of the moments blurring past me, scrapbooking became a way to physically demarcate every special memory. 


I scrolled the internet, religiously. I gravitate towards pieces of great granduer - large-scale infra projects, the history of Tokyo's neighborhoods - as well as abstract interiority - how writing feeds into our sense of belonging and the like. 

at work im still chasing the highs of feeling on top of the world - i have faced some close calls but nothing in particular jumps out. 

but really this year was about trying to switch jobs. this endemic feeling of missing your full potential (absurd for a 23 year old to say).

i long feared my senses dulling throughout the years as i age, but i am happy to report i still feel the ranges of emotion - intense constipation (emotionally), happiness, sadness. i like sweetness less now - i finally pick up on the bitterness of coffee. 

### events
in 2024 i committed to hosting more spaces for creative play.

In 2024 winter I met Simon at a house party & we bonded over our Fujifilm cameras. Though his Fuji camera collection came and went, our friendship remained, as we explored the city neighborhood by neighborhood. 

An IG-feed felt insufficient to showcase our photos, and so we returned to the physical spaces. In June we hosted a photo gallery in Midtown, featuring photos taken during some of our photowalks in Chinatown and travels around the world. We rented out a photo studio in the fall and wrapped up the year with a scrapbooking event with all our fav printed photos! 

Comfort is a warm bowl of hot soup, brushing elbows with friends around a folding dining table. Permission to linger at the table long after the wine is drunk, a place to unwind in the presence of others. Food as a love language is over-wrought, but the meals I cooked with friends meant the world to me: preparing my mom's dumpling recipe for CNY, steaming our faces over hot pot, crafting matchas with powder Vinny brought from Japan.

What is life without good food, a glass of wine, and a space to unwind? Food as a love language is overwrote but it means all the same. Comfort is shared around hot food and the permission to linger at the table, long after the plate has been cleared. It's cheesy but these are the moments that made the city feel like a home: making my mom's dumpling recipe, steaming our faces over hot pot, crafting matchas with powder Vinny brought from Japan. 

I knew I cultivated good friendships at my final going-away party - and people brought Royce chocolate, charcuterie, and plentiful wine. 


certain contradictions emerge this year:
e.g. how much i really care about certain friendships

five niche feelings i felt this year
### ai will never feel these emotions 

1. nausea 
together w k we catch up in the corner of heytea. i tell her about the startups i am thinking about, how congested i feel at work. i drink heytea's grape boom, zero calorie sugar, and i balloon. 

is it possible that emptiness feels so heavy? for the larger part of summer into fall i was circling the rather hollow ennui of being stuck in a job misaligned with my personal values. 

the past week has been marked by a relentless heaviness in my throat, like there's a dammed up river and at any moment it'll break and expel whatever waste is left inside. 

there's a weekend when i don't see the light and i instead ingest the world around me. 
closed-box system. 

- Who do I want to be?
- What am I willing to commit to for years?
- What’s worth being “a little crazy” for?



2. awe

there's something voyeuristic about viewpoints — the nature placed at an arm’s length, the buildings and ocean collaborating to create an idyllic frame for our consumption. man decidedly separate from nature.

under the trees i feel decidedly small. it's a familiar feeling, and i embrace it. to be a coastal elite means to fancy yourself the main character. 

this impulse has a name: the capacity for awe.

3. chosen cringe

*everyone wants to be a dj but no one wants to dance.* 
unbashed joy in the dance floor 

earnestness

if you write with enough academic earnestness and intellectual curiosity 
there is a chance you will get famous for doing the work you love
wouldnt you rather get famous doing the work you love rather than repeating content you hate?
