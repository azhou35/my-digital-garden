()[()thoughts on algorithmic music:
- is there an "algorthmically perfect" song?
- how do we define 'style'
	- is asking a machine to describe a style the same as inputting a style into a machine? 
- how is this different/more "unethical" compared to vocaloid music?]()
huge cluster
c263 

gcp case 
- we can do 
for azure crd we have to drain everthing
structural work to make it less manual 
- operational cluster

c253 

scheduling -
10 - 15 min ()
punt the rest unless 
do calcium-a 

how we do this and we do the fw updates
operationalize 
start to assemble

being used to do argon - so pretty stable

- every island is a backend cluster 
- every island have disjoint clusters - we just put some into
	- failure domain is within a fabric
	- allocate users at a fabric level
	- a job cant schedule between fabrics 
- fleet-sla is 

titanium
azure constraints
- just scaling down nodes - happy to sign up for that 
	- net to free 
	- hr a work
- if we do repave - things tend to go sideways
	- if we rebuild its scary
- clusters named after elements / whales
	- built using legacy cluster infra
	- quite frustrating
	- go/research-cluster/turnup
- new means of building clusers that can stand that up in an hour or two 
- you get 90% of the way there 
	- last 10 % is debugging 
	- trying to stabilize these transitions 
- every cluster is a zbs cluster
- they will transition 
- take the element cluster
	- 5k nodes 
	- wants to take that and slice it up 
- week of 15th - we can talk into the power maintenance
- all new clusters come up as zbs

sg - @deniz apologies for the late heads up on this, but there is meaningful derisking to the jobs on titanium-c if we do a mass repave - even if we only repave codex nodes, the nodes may cycle to your workloads eventually

the other option is 
ask Azure to fix nodes as we OFR them, and keep the temp mitigation where we don't ban nodes seeing this error ()
