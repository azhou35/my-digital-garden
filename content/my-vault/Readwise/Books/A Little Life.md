- and pleasure he felt. The other aspect of those weekday-evening trips he loved was the light itself, how it filled the train like something living as the cars rattled across the bridge, how it washed the weariness from his seat-mates’ faces and revealed them as they were when they first came to the country, when they were young and America seemed ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=442))
- At five thirty, the light was perfect: buttery and dense and fat somehow, swelling the room as it had the train into something expansive and hopeful. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=473))
- mere everyday profundity of its disappearance, he was unable to say. Now ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=522))
- sober, taking pictures of his three friends as they moved in their own patterns, unaware that he was trailing them. At one point, a couple of hours in, he found them by the window with just one another, Jude saying something and the other two leaning in close to hear him, and then in the next moment, the three of them leaning ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=567))
- gave everything, as if someone had patted away the top layer of clarity and left behind something kinder than the eye alone would see. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=590))
- he had reflexively covered his mouth with his hand, a tic that the rest of them had found upsetting, and which he had only learned to stop doing in the past ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=602))
- printed with poems: second-rate ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=635))
- anger and beauty reduced to empty aphorisms. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=636))
- think about the war, and they certainly didn’t want to talk about it with naïfs who were still eagerly dashing toward the trenches, who were still excited to be in-country. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=700))
- When did pursuing your ambitions cross the line from brave into foolhardy? How did you know when to stop? In earlier, more rigid, less ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=711))
- history as quiet as a briquette of ice sliding into a warm bath. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=715))
- were days of self-fulfillment, where settling for something that was not quite your first choice of a life seemed weak-willed and ignoble. Somewhere, ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=715))

- spoke with his parents in Swedish, and it wasn’t until many years later, when a Swedish director he was working with pointed out how affectless his voice became when he switched into the language, that he recognized that he had unconsciously learned to adopt a certain tone when he talked to his parents, one emotionless and blunt, that was ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=855))
- somewhere within them ran a thin stream of quick, cool water, teeming with delicate lives, minnows and grasses and tiny white flowers, all tender and easily wounded and so vulnerable you couldn’t see them without aching for them. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=872))
- He wondered, sometimes, if they envied him the dexterity of being able to fall and get up again, and if so, if he should stop doing it, but when he asked his supervisor, he had only looked at Willem and said that the kids thought he was funny and that he should ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=896))
- was like any relationship, he felt—it took constant pruning, and dedication, and vigilance, and if neither party wanted to make the effort, why wouldn’t it wither? The ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=921))
- the trees above and around him blotting out the light, making it too dark for him to see whether the lake he was in opened up into a river or whether it was contained, its ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=940))
- looking for that same elusive tributary, ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=944))
- porch light washed the night with honey. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=957))

He was missing, it seemed, the sense of victimization and woundedness and perpetual anger it took to be black, but he was certain ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1102))

- He let the silence pull between them until he imagined he could hear it ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1238))
- Willem had always been careful not to express too much interest in exploring the many cupboarded cabinet in which Jude had secreted himself. ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1264))
- and the days unfurled before him as clean as paper, and with each day he said nothing, ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1286))

- State Building’s gaudy, graceless bulk, its tower aglow with a garish blue light that ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1331))
- made him think of gas stations, and the long drive back to his parents’ ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1332))
- had always been mystified by Jude’s hyper-preparedness, his dedication to finding disaster everywhere—he had long ago noticed Jude’s habit of, upon entering any ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1359))
- Sundays were for walking. The walks had begun out of necessity five years ago, when he ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1422))
- found it both relaxing and educational to sit there late at night and listen to them. His silence was both a necessity and a protection, and had the added benefit of making him appear more mysterious and more interesting than he knew he was. “What about you, Jude?” ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1573))
- “you have to be so genuinely uncategorizable that the normal terms of identity don’t even apply to you.” JB had ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1583))
- shared language of childhood pratfalls and frustrations. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1596))
- understood that friendship was a series of exchanges: of affections, of time, sometimes of money, always of information. And he had no money. He had nothing to give them, he had nothing to offer. He couldn’t ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1645))
- increments. In those days, before he learned it was better to be still, he would flop on his bed like a fish on a boat deck, his free hand scrabbling for a halyard line to cling to for safety, the hospital mattress ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1706))

- had always thought suffered unfairly from a poor translation. The standard interpretation of the first line was “I am lost to the world,” but he read it as “I have become lost to the world,” which, he believed, was less self-pitying, less melodramatic, and more resigned, more confused. I have become lost to the world / In which I otherwise wasted so much time. The lied ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=1872))

Therefore, two must be real.’ But this isn’t actually true, ([Location 2136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=2136))
- He experienced the singular pleasure of watching people he loved fall in love with ([Location 2195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=2195))
- “If I were a different kind of person, I might say that this whole incident is a metaphor for life in general: things get broken, and sometimes they get repaired, and in most cases, you realize that no matter what gets damaged, life rearranges itself to compensate for your loss, sometimes wonderfully. ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=2304))
- and letting this accident become its own conclusion, seemed easier than making the decision himself, a decision that would ripple past him to include ([Location 2493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=2493))
- will be reminded that he is a nothing, a scooped-out husk in which the fruit has long since mummified and shrunk, ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=2678))
- And in his face, I knew my own would be echoed. The impossibility of finding someone to do such a thing for another person, so unthinkingly, so gracefully! ([Location 2720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=2720))
- Every day, your first thought is not “I love him” but “How is he?” ([Location 2819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=2819))

- of friendship, I think, is to find people who are better than you are—not smarter, not cooler, but kinder, and more generous, and more forgiving—and then to appreciate them for what they can teach you, and to try to listen to them when they tell you something about yourself, no matter how bad—or good—it might be, and to trust them, which is the hardest thing of all. But the best, as well.” ([Location 3663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=3663))
- Friendship was witnessing another’s slow drip of miseries, and long bouts of boredom, and occasional triumphs. It was feeling honored by the privilege of getting to be present for another person’s most dismal moments, and knowing that you could be dismal around him in return. ([Location 3899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=3899))
- complicity, one he never intended to play. Everything Jude communicated to them indicated that he didn’t ([Location 3952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=3952))
- success. It was the difference between running and running in place, and although running was boring no matter what, at least the person running was ([Location 4598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=4598))

- math rewards simplicity, and mathematicians value it above all else. So it’s no surprise that Walter’s favorite axiom was also the most simple in the realm of mathematics: the axiom of the empty set. ([Location 4935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=4935))
- we can say that life itself is the axiom of the empty set. ([Location 4939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=4939))

- one side is everything he knows, the patterns of his existence as regular and banal as the steady plink of a dripping faucet, where he is alone but safe, and shielded from everything that could hurt him. On the other side are waves, tumult, rainstorms, excitement: everything he cannot control, everything potentially awful and ecstatic, everything he has lived his adult life trying to avoid, everything whose absence bleeds his life of color. Inside ([Location 5436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=5436))
- building is sepulchral around him. ([Location 5838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=5838))
- else. He would pretend he was something inanimate—a curtain rod, a ceiling fan—a dispassionate, unfeeling witness to the scene occurring beneath him. He would watch himself and feel nothing: not pity, not anger, nothing. ([Location 5851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=5851))
- equals x: it assumes that if you have a conceptual thing named x, that it must always be equivalent to itself, that it has a uniqueness about it, that it is in possession of something so irreducible that we must assume it is absolutely, unchangeably equivalent to itself for all time, that its very elementalness ([Location 5883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=5883))
- bifurcated ([Location 6077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=6077))
- like how a cat purrs to itself when it’s alone in the ([Location 6190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=6190))
- with their froth of pink blossoms, and the tulips, their glossed, improbable colors, and the new grass, soft and tender beneath him. ([Location 6427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=6427))
- else. In fallow periods—the moments before you fell asleep; the minutes before you were landing after an overnight flight, when you weren’t awake enough to do work and weren’t tired enough to sleep—they ([Location 6591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=6591))

- had seemed to him the ideal expression of an adult relationship, to have someone with whom you could discuss the mechanics of a shared existence. ([Location 8312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=8312))
- memories were tableaux, not narratives, and he would see a single one repeatedly ([Location 8733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=8733))
- for Willem, he recognizes that this is a long eel of a memory, slippery and uncatchable, and it whipsaws its way through him, its tail slapping against his organs so that he feels the memory as something alive and wounding, feels its meaty, powerful smack against his ([Location 8762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=8762))
- bone-deep ([Location 8799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=8799))
- back. That week, even the things that would irritate you—the alarm ([Location 8954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=8954))
- a dinghy, rocking wildly on the waves, but then righting itself again and sailing placidly on, even though the waters beneath it were black and filled with monsters and floes of seaweed that threatened ([Location 9022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=9022))
- long ugly night lurches on, and he sleeps, a shallow, furtive slumber, and when he wakes, it isn’t quite daylight, but he pulls on his clothes ([Location 9225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=9225))

- And then, two days later, something happens. He has just come home, so exhausted that he feels soluble, as if he is evaporating into the air, so insubstantial that he feels made not of blood and bone but of vapor and fog, when he sees Willem standing before him. He ([Location 11936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PCZO0&location=11936))
