American Blackness was fundamental and foundational to America, after all, but Black life appeared not only set apart but unequally so. In college, I once got my hair braided over ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=139))
- peculiar American expression that professed agreement rather than knowledge, ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=195))

- You are the absolute love of my life,” he’d written in her last birthday card—and yet there was cement in her soul. It had been there for a while, an early morning disease of fatigue, a bleakness and borderlessness. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=233))
- brief imaginary glints of other lives she could be living, ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=235))

- good, bewildered man, and felt the day take on a sad, epic quality. They had lived together for three years, three years free of crease, like a smoothly ironed sheet, until their only fight, months ago, when Blaine’s eyes froze with blame and he refused to speak to her. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=249))
- relationship with him was like being content in a house but always ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=256))
- sitting by the window and looking out. “Take the plant,” he said to her, on the last day she saw him, ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=257))
- Sometimes, she still felt it. How was it possible to miss something you no longer wanted? Blaine needed what she was unable to give and she needed what he was unable to give, and she grieved this, the loss of what could have been.

- She was such a devoted woman, such a well-meaning, devoted woman. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=632))
- And, in the pride in her eyes, he saw a shinier, better version of himself. He ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=636))

- but a draining lassitude that numbed the margins of his ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=734))

- That first summer was Ifemelu’s summer of waiting; the real America, she felt, was just around the next corner she would turn. Even the days, sliding one into the other, languorous and limpid, the sun lingering until very late, seemed to be waiting.

- WRAPPED in gauze; she could see the shapes of things but ([Location 2235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=2235))
- It had to be that Americans were taught, from elementary school, to always say something in class, no matter what. And so she sat stiff-tongued, surrounded by students who were all folded easily on their seats, all flush with knowledge, not of the subject of the ([Location 2277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=2277))

- longer knew how; it had slipped from her memory, the ability to care. Sometimes she woke up flailing and helpless, and she saw, in front of her and behind her and all around her, an utter hopelessness. She knew there was no point in being here, in being alive, but she had no energy to think concretely of how she could kill herself. She lay in bed and read books and thought of nothing. Sometimes she forgot to eat and other times she waited until midnight, her roommates ([Location 2655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A9ET4MC&location=2655))
