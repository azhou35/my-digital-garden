- When feedback is tied not merely to the way machines work but instead to the things we value most—our social circles, our self-image—it can become the map by which we chart our lives. It can determine how the experiences around us feel. In an era when how a product feels to use is the measure of how much we’ll use it, this is everything.

- asked if he had any designs that he lived with that he admired. Norman looked around, and then his gaze settled on his watch: a black Braun, whose clean lines and haute-utilitarian face were descended from the famous models designed by Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs in the 1960s. Except the watch face was marred by one detail: In addition to the analog hands, there was a honking ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HF2M7ZN&location=644))
