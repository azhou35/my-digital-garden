	1) initial velocity
	2) option 2 w a few switches
	3) upgrade 2 of the switches & monitor next week

1. lack of tickets
2. access to logs

NVIDIA field diagnostics
- on your side you'll see the node has drpoped a gpu 
- set of field diagnostics tool 
- tool nvidia developed in python that puts gpus thru a series of tests
	- either yields a pass or fail 
	- sends it to nv either thru supercell or dell
	- given initial log

eri/mihai - including field diagnostic in all the ticket - without runing all diagnostics
- difficult that in azure we need to wait for datacenter to take data with diagnostic os 
- run the file diag 
- coreweave analayzes diag files

how do we have the field daignostic given to us in the start

for gb200s - having the right field diag - including the fiel ddiag in the tickets - bring something back capacity sooner

when andy feels an issue w a node a DC-T sees a node blink
- Gene working on a tool that would drain the node ourselves 

automate some of the 


GPU fall of the bus is a common issue
- we'll run the node thru a validation 
- read that gpu fals of a bus 
- coreweave puts it thru field diagnostic and is unable to reproduce it
- when they ask nvidia on why
- new tool - SMB PBI
	- measures each of the gpus and measures the tower
	- creates a result file - binary hex codes
	- nvidia decrypts the file
	- most of life 

at leat 3-4 things that happen
for BM - no control plane - hard to diagnose it without tooling
- without tooling to reproduce and catch them
- integrate into our stats
- run the script 

thermal limit 
- edge case - gpu reaches a thermal throttling limit
- field diagnostic doesnt catch it 
- mihai has it up and running
- script will get the results
- mihai has to take an hour 

its not automated

Full cluster maintenance - 
- Go thru Avi/Wes

For direct clusters -
- leaf switch reboots - we havent had cluster wide maintenance

Thru the ones GCP 
- GB200s - impactful maintenances

calcium - substantial maintenance
B200s

1) get the hardware buffer visibile somewhere / zoku 
2) capacity tpm / cluster planning buy in / rpm
