- Thanks for the summary, Kenny. Just to clarify, the threat model for this particular issue is the same on a shared RoCE backend physical fabric vs. single-tenant fabric because the vulnerability kill chain requires local host command execution privileges. I expect everyone knows this already, but for posterity I'll restate that a shared RoCE backend physical fabric has rock-solid virtual network tenant isolation, and you should feel secure from attack by another tenant riding that same physical infrastructure. Let's circle back up after New Years. I understand that NVIDIA is in the process of loosening the reins on this pair of vulnerabilities, and is in the process of giving us permission to talk with you in greater detail. Until then, rest easy, enjoy the holiday break, and we'll let you know if the situation changes and we need to spring to action.
