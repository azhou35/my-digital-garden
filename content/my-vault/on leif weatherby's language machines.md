- Weatherby has a few fundamental points that support his understanding of LLMs. The first is that LLMs produce language. This might seem obvious, but as Weatherby makes clear, some linguists insist that LLMs are _not_ producing language. T**his is the view of Noam Chomsky, whom Weatherby uses to illustrate what he calls the “syntax” view of language, which proposes that language is located in the brain, meaning there is some underlying biological, cognitive structure that allows us to use language—a “universal grammar**.” From this view, LLMs don’t produce language but rather a pale imitation of it, as they lack the underlying cognitive function that would give rise to language. This scientific view of language, which seems to me to be a sort of biological determinism, leaves us ill equipped to understand the output of LLMs, as all it can do is say, “that’s not language,” dismissing the matter as someone else’s concern.
- “statistics” view, prevalent among some computational linguists, which says that we “know a word by the company it keeps.” Proponents of this view _do_ believe that LLMs produce language, and they view LLMs as vindication for their view of language, since these models work by using statistical relationships among words to produce the next word in a sequence, generating sentences that are often indistinguishable from human language
- Neither the syntax view nor the statistics view is satisfactory for Weatherby’s goals, however; if the syntax view ignores the output of LLMs in search of a natural source for language, then the statistics view focuses too much on the output of these machines, ignoring the search for an explanatory theory of language
- “great rationalization” here is analogous to the shift Weatherby outlines from the humanities to the sciences, and the idea that language “communicate[s] our thoughts, feelings and intentions” is based on the idea that language is referential—first we have something inside or outside of ourselves, which exists before language, and then we convey that information in language. This explanation assumes that reference is the primary function of language—an idea Weatherby calls the “ladder of reference”—with other functions, such as the poetic function, built on top. Weatherby disagrees with this idea, claiming that LLMs show language to be poetic first and referential second; in other words, since LLMs cannot refer to the external, physical world—only its representation in language—an LLM can never escape language, meaning it can never be primarily referential
