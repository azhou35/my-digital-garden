My social media usage skyrocketed during the pandemic â€” and subsequently tanked. Before then I was a little dopamine monkey perking up at every comment, DM, and message that came my way. But when the only tie I had to the outside world was siphoned through pixels and notification pings, the allure quickly wore off. 

Instagram, Facebook, Discord, Tik Tok. It became [too much](everything.md). It was cotton candy. All sweet, no substance. 

It's tragic how teenagers, the people who use social media the most, are also simultaneously going through an ongoing identity crisis. To construe your own identity based on arbitrary socials is to set yourself up for failure. Perhaps the one "good" thing about growing up on the Internet is how well-documented my search for "self" has been. Middle school I used Google+ and clung to obsessive fandom behavior in lieu of personality -> high school I carved out a picture-perfect yet reliably quiRky personality on Instagram. The problem about these all-encompassing platforms that tech juggernauts expound is that I felt compelled to use it for everything.
