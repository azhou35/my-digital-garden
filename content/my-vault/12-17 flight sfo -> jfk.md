title: "12-17 flight sfo -> jfk"

it drizzles in the morning, and im pissed bc i packed away my raincoat, never bothered to buy an umbrella, isn't this place supposed to have better weather anyways?

by 2 the sky clears. i rush to my flight home & en route the uber driver asks if i've seen the view outside the window. tbh i rarely look up during these regular rides, too dark to see outside, head down-turned down for last minute messages before another droopy red-eye, bc i told myself maybe this time i'll sleep. 

but i never really do, so today i fly out in the afternoon. the sky is bright. someone once told me: sf is prettiest when you're leaving it. 

& when i look out the window the bay is postcard blue, melts into motion blur, a streak of gauze against the mountain slope. *look, three planes*, and mr. uber driver points at streaks in the sky, shooting stars reversing into the atmosphere. 

it's funny how the camera is modeled after human sight -- focus, aperture, field of vision -- yet i still use them as a way to understand how we see. an airplane window is a narrow aperture, forcing a world into a frame. way above the fog, you can see the golden gate bridge in the back. it's all about framing, really. do i see my life as days in between filghts, or times my body is one place over the other, or the liminal space between? 

i think i can like this place. if i rent a car (and learn how to pump gas by myself) & drive out to marin, sausalito, south bay. if i embrace this feeling of ignorance and insignificance, read it more as awe rather than isolation. 

january named after *janus*, god of entries and doorways. frames and endings. often called two-faced, he represents opposing states, as one face looks backwards to the past and the other looks forward to the future. 

in 2025, i spent the year circling a core set of tensions. doorways i hovered in, such that i didn't have to choose a side. the following is a list of contradictions i've held within me: 

### 1. friendships and their importance 

you can't force friendships. there will be many potential friends that will never pass the activation energy to sustain themselves. trust compounds with time, but only if you keep showing up. 

 openness isn't the same thing as care. plenty of coastal elites will try a new restaurant, a new hobby, a new scene. but a smaller subset have the _audacity to care._
 
it's these hidden decisions that keep me up at night. you decline one person's bid for connection, and that door could be closed forever. 

"but it is important to note that curating your milieu isn't only or even primarily about being picky. it is about how you relate to people."

The ethos should be a sum of our values, but it won't directly map onto our individual motivations, and sometimes that ethos is as simple as _I care about this friend group and I will show up, over and over again

#### 2. you can be authentic & still perform

2025 was the year of performative males, bemoaning the persona who holds tote bags and drinks matcha. i found this trend quite peculiar - isn't all a life a performance? style is a reflection of the persona you project into the world - our decisions are borne out of how we want to be perceived by others. 

personal blogging blew up, everyone has a tik tok account for their hobby. 

authenticity is the degree to which a person's actions are congruent with their with their values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity. sometimes it's ok to live aligned with your dream self - aka fake it until you make it. for one, i struggle to write opinion pieces or commentary because i feel constrained by 1st person pieces that i have authority behind. 



#### 3. alignment is a means, not an end

i used to think i needed to tough things out before i could deserve a life that was meant for me. the natural post-grad formula is to stick to a job you hate for 2+ years, find another job you hate marginally less, before maybe taking a paycut for a job aligned with yonur true interests. 

i also started my career believing i could separate my psyche between my 9-5 and 5-9, and use the freedom of my day job to fuel my creative passions. the truth is, i'm picky and impatient. i have a list of core values - it's better to seek alignment with those values with all dimensions of my life, earlier rather than later.  

seek constraints 

#### 4. zoom out - are you participating in life? 

i love social events & hate participating in them. i bring my fujifilm to parties as a social a buffer, an instrument to separate myself from the scene. i host events so i can control the entire scene end to end. i go to concerts and instead of listening to the music, watch the people around me. 

i can't help it. i write in passive voice - i see time as passing thru me, rather than me passing through time. 

in 2026 i want to be more active in living in the moment, which entails

#### 5. what do we build vs what do we maintain?

#### 6. prestige is a finite game
i'll be honest: i'm a prestige whore. in eugene wei's piece on social media they all amplify different vices and substack tickles a particular itch: the desire to be seen as intellectual. 

the reason why a lot of us in our 20s feel unfulfilled is because we're tired of chasing the prestige game. i catch up with s and j for monthly read-outs on i-banking and consulting and their toxic work environments. 

is a promotion worth it without respect? are benefits any meaning without freedom? 

we gravitate toward games with legible scoreboards. where progress can be clocked at a glance. in adulthood, those scoreboards look like LinkedIn titles, compensation bands, follower counts, or the vague but powerful sense that other people are impressed.

it's hard to ignore the numbers, the hit of getting a job other people are jealous of. social media - tik tok, substack, instagram - has been another game for our generation to play.
