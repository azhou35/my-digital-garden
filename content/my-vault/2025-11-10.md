oncall notes
- OpenSM runs on UFM nodes 
	- https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C09RF74EMN1
- feedback 
	- lot to keep up w known issues of various clusters

can pipe it into other places 
five tran - if everything i sconsistent
enter five tran
how u can u join all the data 
grafana is not as needed 

within the quarter
- figure out what thing as highest leverage
- unforseeable scope creep
- bc we see we cant see entire problem
	- can only do it after next compute shuffle
- what is highest leverage
	- we dont work on this until X
	- let angela/shantanu know waht is blocking us until then
		- how do we 
- short-term goal - how do we make more of the fleet flex
- why does workload suck? read global schedulign
- how do we make as much of capacity fungible to other ppl
- track idle capacity
	- num of gpus that can be scheduled by everybody 
	- ease of use 

          Q1 -> Q2 -> Q3
    wS_1    1k -> 900 -> 850
		 1k -> 1200 -> 1500 

how do rpms handle this 
why is one of our larget clusters
split in 280 vs 280 vs 280 


binpacking the right way 
binpacking - biggest quota - within 6k 
	what can i put in 
small chunks is not using it
biggest user 


look into ept in foundations - biggest job is 8200 

rislow - is LAO. foos rhinf 
on average - our largest 

how do we make it flex

how do we use more of our fleet 

general higher ai compute and scheduling systems
