Warning: spoilers for "Everything, Everywhere, All at Once" ahead. If you haven't seen this masterpiece you MUST go see it. 

In one scene of A24's 2022 smash hit, the camera pans out to reveal protagonist Evelyn, slumped against a long table cluttered with papers. Thoughts of laundry and taxes and family and husbands and failed opportunities violently attack her mind, until we hear her heart beating and her vision go dizzy. A black title card emboldened with "Everything" explodes onto screen. 

I enjoy movies that make me feel. And boy, did that movie make me feel—and think—a lot. In the big picture, the movie discusses nihilism, chaos theory, and intergenerational trauma, all topics right up my alley. Zoom in and the scenes are scarily accurate parallels to my reality. When Evelyn saw her many potential lives splayed in front of her, I viscerally felt her agony, as she overturned every previous decision in her life and how it led her to what she thought was the worst timeline. I'm drawn to this narrative because it's a frequent taunt in the back of my mind, and I love seeing how different media abstract this human strife. Like Esther describing the fig tree in the "Bell Jar." 

Regarding nihilism, this movie also paints a bittersweet outlook that I think is the closest to optimism and realism. Yes, nothing matters, but that's the point! If nothing matters, then *everything* matters—everything that you want to matter. I love seeing the world as a googly eye, the ying to the otherwise bleary yang. Of course this level of optimism is also an oversimplification of life, but as someone who has been overwhelmed by the sheer sensory overload of [living in the internet](Social Media.md), living in this interconnected world, it gives me something to look forward to. That the randomness of life makes it scary and chaotic, but also gives it beauty. 

There are lingering thoughts in my mind. The tension between the mother and daughter, but also how my own mom hated the movie when she watched it. Existential dread and how it's a pit that has no end. 

In the future, I hope we abandon the "half-empty/half-full" question in favor of this: do you see the world as a googly eye? Or a bagel? 

And I hope EEAO inspires us to choose the former.
