<font color="">the way you live your days is how you live your life.</font>

i love the trees. they're comforting and remind me of home, or maybe coming home. 

*reasons to live*
the perfect buttery croissant flaking uncontrollably. 
dancing, the type where your arms move before your mind does, dancing without caring, dancing in flashing lights, dancing in the dark, to dance despite it all.
good meals with good friends, over-indulgent in a way. free-flowing wine, a slight buzz. a squeeze of the hand. half hugs, of which i am notorious for.
picnics in the sun, 
leaves, kaleidoscoping on the ground, pinhole for the lights.
swimming in july  

as time goes on your senses dull - i fear the day childhood foods like mozz sticks and pizza become bland, warm blankets no longer soft to the touch. or somehow the colors of the fall don't match the vibrance of my memory. when i lose control over the year going by i feel this anxiety. new experiences come and pass through me, that they melt on my tongue. 

i'm happy to report that i will still feel these feelings. it feels kind of amazing 
the stillness of the catskills, the vibrance of miami/vegas. 

i bridged the gap between who i am and who i wanna be. is changing jobs all i really needed?
