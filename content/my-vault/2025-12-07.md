friday night, i log off work. headphones in, always. cue the drums, whiplash-style. slack notifs spam my inbox but i peel myself away for the night i’ve jam-packed: the latest restaurant opening, then drinks at a cocktail bar, then endless noise, swallowed whole by the pulsating strobe lights, the void of a ceaseless crowd.

i am hungry for new experiences, to see more interesting things and become an interesting person who does interesting things. i desire novelty and i want it now. classic city dweller, chasing the latest restaurant opening or new movie release, suburban squirrel in search of elusive chestnut. but i fear my appetite is getting out of control.

first weekend back in the city and i’m recovering from an emotional hangover. so i take a walk.

fall is my favorite season, but i’ve just missed its peak. the trees lift their scraggly arms in the air, nature’s power lines, _stick season_. having shed their once-orange plume has, time has whittled them down to mere dark marks against slate grey. there’s a different kind of beauty, when you’re looking at dead trees.

i whisper this out loud and witness my breath leave its mark in the air. much like the trees i am in between seasons, between phases of life, and feel awfully naked. camera in hand and no particularly striking subject in view, i learn to read between the lines.

the juncture between november and december has a way of sharpening my senses. that is to mean _i can’t stop noticing things_. the bright pop of an orange beanie, the well-fitting cropped jeans. a habit from anthro class, or maybe it was poetry, where it was taught to pay careful attention to your surroundings. (or maybe it was math class, where the equations bored me out of my mind so i day dreamed and stared at the back of j’s head instead.)

is this why some of the greatest poets come from the most middlest of americas? they spent every day walking past the same tree and learned to fashion it into a symbol. if observing was a muscle, they were training every day.

side-by-side in a smoothie shop, b and i compare our childhoods like pokemon cards, in suburban towns in nj and florida. maybe it’s better we grew up bored, we muse, rather than overwhelmed by nature in the bay area or taking the subway in high school in nyc. (maybe this is cope). growing up in suburbia is like that training montage all i ever wanted to do was to go on an adventure. i’d run past this picket fence, run past the forest of scant trees so fast my past smears behind me like oil paint, a melange of strip malls and bagel worlds and parking lots.

in an undergrad slam poetry class we were tasked with writing about our hometown. i was jealous of the kids who spoke of tramping around in places of extremes, gesturing grandly with their hands. meanwhile my lived experience summed up into tired prose about the cul-de-sacs and the fireflies — i felt myself fade into the backdrop.

in a pay-to-play world i came to believe money and movement as the answer. the post-grad checklist: move to the city, buy that new sezane bag, book that trip to japan. i convinced myself: this will make you write better, this will make you more fun at parties.

but if you change the setting and props, that doesn’t automatically make you the main character.

there’s this tik tok trend where kids take an image of their sleepy hometowns and pretend that it’s some overseas destination like japan. in this absurd comparison between a quiet suburb with a distant travel fantasy, we are pointing out that anything can be beautiful with the right perspective.

ironically i have a soft spot for slice of life, the types of media where nothing really happens. last year i obsessed over the movie _past days_ and n shares with me an american version, set in new jersey. _paterson,_ named for the town and its main character, follows a mild-mannered bus driver and his weekly route around the sleepy town. though his day-to-day rarely changes, he finds passion in the poetry of his routine, and writes about cups of coffee, rain, and conversations.

an endearing and genuine film, _paterson_ hits close to home. anyone can write beautiful things, anywhere. the truth is i don’t need more things to feel more interesting, or to be more interested in my own life. _i just want to feel the life i already have._

an environment that is considered boring is gold for someone who’s trained their attention. i practice this on my commute, people-watcher by practice, enamored by the motion of a mom brushing hair out of her daughter’s eyes or school kids leaning against the door.

our sense of sight is one of our core truths, and the ability to tune it is one of our early skills. it helps us with our friendships and relationships — you notice little quirks better. it’s a go-to party trick — you’re interesting because you always have something to share. it makes you more _interested,_ more importantly, because that self-perception is something no one can take away from you.

so to ask yourself this: _when was the last time you let your mind get quiet enough to actually notice what you want_? in end-of-year reflections we’re tempted to fixate on the big moments, but as annie dillard once said _“how we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”_

these days out west, there’s fewer flashing lights and partiful events to keep me occupied. but my hobbies are all variants of training attention, and i welcome a challenge. in a quieter arena, if you sit still long enough, the joy of finding beauty falls onto you. this is all i really need in life - to write poetry, take photos, journal, to take a walk.
