how to choose discomfort 

why do we choose comfort?

the lights are tuned down low and there's faint korean pop playing in the background. it's just me, me against me, in the dressing room. 

i am here because i am tired of my clothing styles but everything i try on triggers an inner cringe reflex. this black sweater n has plucked out for me is cropped too short, with strange threads fraying at the ends.

i love conversations with new people but i sometimes kick myself afterwards. *that was a bad conversation and i looked stupid.* 

at an ethics event, losing myself in the corner.

but this is actually great for the forced discipline - nothing is more uncomfortable than taking math/physics against your will.
