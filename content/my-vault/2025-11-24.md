oooh, did not realize this was a big run. then yes, this is what we've discussed / agreed to.meanwhile [@tz](https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/team/U07HRSP5C3D) is right that this makes it worse to be allocated to a cluster sharing with a big run, vs a cluster with other teams/projects.

[@carpus](https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/team/U07UKCXRZK9) (from DM, bringing your point here): yeah, if we allocated by our expected SLA of healthy nodes, that would resolve this issue. But we don't have good hygiene around changing quotas (up or down) according to number of healthy nodes.

[@jos](https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/team/U05BAEV0K7G) [@carpus](https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/team/U07UKCXRZK9) - do you have a suggestion for how to manage this? (that's possible today)  
reduce all quotas by a small amount so the healthy nodes aren't oversubscribed?

[#prj-overallocation-research](https://openai.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C09PXLUK7QD) we're actually working on this more holistically and since a few days ago it's already restricted to go beyond hwhealth sla in zoku

[5:18](https://openai.slack.com/archives/C07MLKX96UR/p1763590715050769?thread_ts=1763161206.249799&cid=C07MLKX96UR)

but it's obviously very disruptive to reduce quotas across the board so I think we'll have to do it gradually / during the next quota shuffle

currently there is an SLA for clusters to be >= 85 ~~90~~% healthy.  Iron (c) happens to be 6% unhealthy at the moment.because we allocate 100% of the cluster, the lowest priority quotas feel the 6% unhealthy nodes.if we allocate 85% of the cluster, no quota should feel the 6% unhealthy nodes,to your point, if the cluster exceeds ~~10%~~ unhealthy to >15%, we are in the same spot, but the cluster would be out of SLA and we'd engage hwh team to bring it back to SLA; whereas currently a 6% unhealthy cluster is within SLA.I'm not suggesting waiting until new shuffle -- I'm only sharing with you what we hope to do after break.  As I said previously, I understand there is a need to address the immediate pain (edited)

I think it's esp painful bc there have been free gpus in the big run quota `pt-core-models` this entire weekend (eg. I see 328 free gpus in critical)So if we were to enact a more fair system where SLA of 85% maps to actual min allocation per quota, and then distribute accordingly (eg. everything spilling over 85% goes in priority order), we would've gotten GPUs for our quota, and `pt-core-models` would have been unaffected with their experiments

Also why have SLA at the cluster level vs. the quota level? 94% availability in the cluster isn't useful for us if we are only getting 74% of our quota


2 pocs 
research one doesnt allow u to input data 
davis / kenny is using sigma to enter data into this write back table
you have ur data coming from googlesheets and we're reading it into snowflake
