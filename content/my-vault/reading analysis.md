- self as being fragmented, performance and role 
- **inner life is the real plot**
- interested in power and identity - which operate by shaping interior life 

some prompts:
- 1. **“Who would I be if I weren’t seeking?”**  
    Freewrite for 15 minutes answering Murakami’s question: _Who would I be if I weren’t seeking anything?_ No philosophy, just images, places, habits.
2. 1. **Interior vs. exterior**  
    Describe a normal day entirely from the outside—only what a camera could see. Then rewrite the same day only from the inside—thoughts, memories, sensations. Where do the two versions clash?
	1. 1. **Loneliness as desire for intimacy**  
    Write about a time you felt lonely, but only through what you _wanted to say_ and couldn’t. Let the unsent text, unsent email, or unsaid sentence be the form.
3.
