- "Something you do well in your writing—and I think this is the value of just dipping into all these disciplines and worlds that all have their own vocabulary, their own canonical texts—is figuring out how to translate. It’s like this term means this. Not just describing the surface level, “this is the stuff people are saying or doing,” but “here’s the underlying ideology or philosophy or worldview that is transmitted by this.”
- Writing on the internet feels like constantly playing some kind of mysterious roulette game. [Venkatesh Rao](https://open.substack.com/users/2264734-venkatesh-rao?utm_source=mentions) [describes](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/08/19/the-calculus-of-grit/) it as, in the same way with your investments, you don’t want to time the market, and you just assume that you should invest a lot of money and then over time hopefully receive good investment returns
- period of scarcity -> excess
- ai cant replace investigative writing
	- it can replace shitty work 
	- is this ai slop or personal slop? 
- But because I’m not on TikTok, I notice how many trend articles are just some algorithmic blip that everyone is seeing that week. And everyone feels this extremely strong, powerful need to write about “thot daughters” and how performative they are
- you need to look at a trend online -> and see if it is real 
- - When I was writing my piece about [bait and vice signaling](https://jasmi.news/p/bait), I was trying to decide whether I was taking the bait by even writing about these companies, because I don’t think that most companies in Silicon Valley are doing this. Then I was like, I think the way for me to write is to not take it at face value of “they are saying they’re gonna take all the jobs, therefore they’re going to take all the jobs.” Rather: what is the political economy of the startup scene that incentivizes startups to run these crazy billboards? That was my justification that this is a deeper piece than just a trend piece and taking the bait by posting about it.
- Your framing of bait made me wonder if people are intentionally exploiting this culture journalism hot-take-y way of surveilling internet trends and being like, _this must speak to something deeper_. And to what degree can that be engineered so you can create a totally manufactured trend?
