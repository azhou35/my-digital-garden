"the controversy over ai-generated music elucidates the muddled  authorship within the music industry."

outline
- personal anecdotes w music 
	- emotional music during happy / sad times
	- categories
		- pudding.cool judge ur music 
		- spotify daylists ("happy funky dance")
	- i would pore over genius lyrics descriptions of how artists came to write a specific song
		- kendrick lamar 
		- kanye west 
		- can you separate the art from the artist?
			- controversial as they may be you cannot
- ai music tools 
	- suno
	- other types - autotune / synthesizers
	- controversy 
		- rosie article
		- https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6v83gq66eo 
			- ai artist getting traction
	- music is not just a bunch of key words
		- used to just be rock/country/pop -> now its a huge assortment of vibes, an unmanageable ontology

			- Regarding 'more' subgenres, this is a phenomenon due to the pluralization of music, or fracturing of the mainstream, as a result of streaming. Another related concept is that of long tail distribution, where there are many outliers and individuals that exist outside of the 'critical mass.' The outliers you have, the more sub descriptors you need to continue to categorize.

- bg into music production
- thesis
	-  I’m not here to argue that AI music is good/bad I’m here to argue that our reaction to it is telling us something true:


after my first breakup in high school, 


last week i went to a concert for a recent artist who blew up over instagram for her clairo remix at the webster hall. bedazzled disco ball and three creaky floors. this hall has seen music across the decades, from the latin music hits to early rock and roll venues of the 80s.
closing my eyes to the pulse of latin beats melding with house, i thought back to my favorite scene in cinema the past year: 


- why is suno so controversial? 
- is there an "algorithmically perfect" song? 
	- isnt this just pop / what goes viral on tik tok for max listener retention? 
	- https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-song-that-is-considered-mathematically-perfect-or-is-it-impossible
		- Music isn’t math. Certain aspects of music use basic arithmetic, but so does everything. And complex equations can apply to anything, but just because there are equations that refer to the dimensions of a toilet, doesn’t mean plumbing and physics are one in the same.
- how do we define 'style'
	- is asking a machine to describe a style the same as inputting a style into a machine? 
		- is style:
			- a statistical pattern (what ai sees)
			- lived experience (what we *feel*)
- how is this different/more "unethical" compared to vocaloid music?

authorship within the music process 

the vibe of this piece is to discuss as a technologist examining culture rather than a zealot/skeptic. in the style of jasmine sun but also analyzing what art/performance means to us writ large 
mindfully reconstruct what music means to us as consumers 

Theres also nuances to the type of ai generator -

music breaks down into:
1. production
2. distribution
3. listening/consumption
4. performance
5. remixing 

is ai acceptable in:
1. helping djs select songs to mix / sounds to combine 
2. helping humans curate music
	1. create?
	2. remix?
3. performing as if it were a pop star 

ai. already exists:
- Let's cut the bullshit: this isn't some 'mainstream vs real artists' debate. That 'organic' indie folk darling you worship? Their last album used AI-cleaned vocal takes and algorithmic mastering. That 'underground' SoundCloud rapper flexing their 'authenticity'? Their entire workflow runs through AI tools - from automated beat matching to AI-assisted lyric suggestions.
- Let’s take a quick trip down moral-outrage memory lane: Autotune: "That’s cheating!" - Now even opera singers use it subtly. Synthesizers: "That’s not real music!" - Became the defining sound of the 80s. Drum Machines: "You’re putting drummers out of work!" - Ended up creating entire genres. Sampling: "That’s just stealing!" - Now it’s an art form. DAWs: "Real musicians use tape!" - Now the absolute industry standard. VSTs: "Plugins will kill real instruments!" - Now orchestral film scores are made with them. Vocaloids: "That’s not real singing!" - Now featured in Grammy-nominated work. DJ Culture: "They're not real musicians!" - Now headline festivals MP3: "This sounds like trash!" - Became the global standard
aka what is truly sacred in music?

4. is it like a popstar
5. is it an up ans coming indie star
6. or is it the hobbyist

two feedback loops

A) artist <> producer → distributor → consumer
B) artist <> ai tool <> distributor → consumer
-> behind an artist there are songwriters, topliners, producers, mastering engineers, A&R input, marketing teams, playlist editors

where is authorship within the process? 

why does music uniquely generate this controversy as opposed to video?
→ video is inherently a technology, whereas music is an inherent natural human

how is this different than tik tok music which is also "tailored" for a specific purposse
**Emotional anchors into music:**
- listening to lauv after breakup
- Listening to nujabes on the way to class
- Vocaloid - there is no human but there was a human creator

music feels as humble as 
- someone taking a guitar and jamming in their bedroom 
- soft bedroom pop
	- ie clairo 
		- but turns out she was a nepo baby
	- we like authenticity iin music but everything is inherently curated for us
- it vibrates air in your chest, it comes out of your throat
- we cannot snthesize instruments out of thin air 
- voice is a story about ur social identity
	- for feld & fox (anthropological paper) a voice carries - 
		- gender norms / class bg / regional background 
		- “Vocal statements are thick descriptions”
		- — the paper paraphrasing Clifford Geertz
		- "Thick description" means:
		- A gesture or sound carries many layers of meaning depending on cultural context.

	- Musicians utilise advanced AI for composing, mixing, mastering, and creating novel sounds, with [18% of daily music uploads now being fully AI-generated](https://musically.com/2025/07/28/how-to-sum-up-the-last-six-months-of-developments-around-ai-and-music/) on platforms like Deezer
	- but [AI-generated content accounts for only 0.5% of total streams](https://musically.com/2025/07/28/how-to-sum-up-the-last-six-months-of-developments-around-ai-and-music/) despite high upload volumes.

	- Technically, it's the **style** that is mimicked, it's not actually copying content.
	- TLDR though, text to music models typically feature a transformer based language/music model sandwiched in-between a compression model such as descript audio codec, facebooks 'encodec' etc, and a text encoder. Compression models are typically gan based or diffusion based. suno/udio have likely trained their own compression models as publicly available versions of these models are mono.
		- compression models take music and 'compress' them into discrete tokens that the language/music transformer model can handle, than decompress the generated tokens by the language/music transformer model back into normal music. text encoders take text and generate embeddings that the model uses to predict its 'music' tokens with.
		- during training, music is combined with text embeddings (usually a description, tags, bpm etc) and fed through the model. Every time this happens the models weights are updated slightly based on the 'loss', which measures the deviation from the target data

	- If you focus on engagement with what you create, you might well have lost the plot. Music isn't about receiving validation, it's about sending a small piece of yourself out into the world and expressing yourself.
https://www.reddit.com/r/SunoAI/comments/1ltaiey/suno_is_not_a_music_generator/
Suno isn't a composer; it's a hyper-advanced pattern-matching machine. It's piecing together audio data based on statistical probability, not musicality or emotion
- **The problem isn't that the AI is "resampling"; it's that the user is just accepting the result.**
- It's a black box spitting out a statistically likely result.
- what constitutes as human slow? 
	-  is it human reaction?
	- Ive seen it where people have cried and that cant happen without soul in the song. That is, if you believe the soul in songs is being able to evoke feelings at a deeper level.
