title: "hawaii trip post-mortem"
---

i am extremely frustrated with how mich/esther handled this situation in terms of
- agreeing to go on this trip
- becoming wishy washy once it came to details and time to commit
	- i booked ticket as forcing fucntion for ppl to commit
	- instead ppl saw it as a constraint and decided to prioritize things over it
- michelle wouldnt give us a clear answer of whether or not she could go
	- said she felt really bad about flaking but also felt bad about skipping out on the concert
	- eventually gave us the reason that she doesnt know what to do in oahu and it was too expensive and she would be stressed 
		- which is so stupid bc oahu is the first place anyone goes to 
		- and also she's going to a trip to taiwan 
		- so this logic doesnt make any sense
- esther also wouldnt give clear answer on whether she wanted to go 
	- said she would only go to maui 
any relationship requires you to commit
- true friendship requires you to commit
	- it is not enough to be endlessly open -> you need to convert intent into action 
	- if you needlessly choose any friend over this group its a clear indication the group is not stable 

why do i struggle so hard to maintain these female friendships?
- ifl most people are able to plan trips & action with their friend group
	- or go out w their girlie friends or dress up for halloween or take digicam photos 
	- i want friendships that are reliable & enthusiastic
- but with any girl group we have so many big ideas but we never action on anything 
- i am initiator/planner and i like to commit 
	- i dont like casual / flaky / vibes based groups
	- i dont like lack of communication and being caught off guard w a feed of information retroactively
