### **Bicoastal living isn’t just for the ultra-wealthy. Here’s how younger creatives make it work.**

_Rewritten in plain text_

Ari Takata-Vasquez sometimes wakes up unsure which city she’s in. One morning in May, she thought she heard an Oakland police officer making an announcement outside her downtown apartment. But she wasn’t in Oakland at all — she was in her Brooklyn place, listening to a school loudspeaker across the street. This kind of time-zone confusion is one of the quirks of living bicoastally.

Takata-Vasquez is one of a growing number of younger people who split their time between California and New York. Many of them aren’t wealthy; they’re freelance artists or small-business owners. They travel constantly to maintain ties to communities, customers, and creative opportunities in both places.

Hyungi Park, a tattoo and incense artist, travels between Los Angeles and New York every three weeks. She’s been doing this for over a year and says that despite the travel, it’s worth it and still feels like a dream.

More people have been living far away from their workplaces since the pandemic. Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford professor who studies remote work, says that number has more than doubled. But this trend is different from remote tech workers relocating. These creatives feel professionally and personally anchored to both coasts — and more people are following their lead.

For example, Oakland jeweler Chelsea Calalay, 30, hopes to sublet a place in New York next year. She says she needs to go where her customers are.

Still, living bi-coastally is not easy. California and New York are about 2,500 miles apart, both have extremely expensive housing markets, and flights often cost hundreds of dollars. Park, who grew up in Texas and North Carolina, found a system that works: she pays for housing only in Los Angeles, where she also has a storefront, and her partner pays for their Brooklyn apartment.

Takata-Vasquez, 34, a muralist and designer who grew up in Hawaii, splits her year seasonally: spring and fall in Brooklyn, summer and winter in Oakland. She sublets whichever apartment she’s not living in, and says there’s always demand for rentals in those markets.

Home-swapping has also made bicoastal life easier. Kindred, a home-exchange platform, has grown sevenfold in the past year and now has 150,000 members. Founder Justine Palefsky says New York is their most popular city, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles, and the most requested swap is between L.A. and New York.

Electronic musician and composer Amma Ateria, 42, lives between San Francisco, Albany (California), and Brooklyn by staying with family and friends. She says the lifestyle is challenging and exhausting — she hates packing so much that it sometimes makes her cry — but she’s trying to manage it with grace.

Despite the fatigue, all three artists are committed to both coasts. They rely on each place for different reasons. Ateria says the Bay Area is where she rests, focuses, and works quietly on her music, while New York is where she performs, pushes herself creatively, and finds the venues that support her career.

Takata-Vasquez feels deeply connected to both the Black Puerto Rican side of her family in New York and the Oakland community she’s been part of for 17 years.

Park says bicoastal life is less glamorous than people assume but also more doable, thanks to apartment swaps and airline mileage deals. By May, she had already taken 12 flights between L.A. and New York this year, often working on her laptop during the flights.

When people ask her to choose between L.A. and New York, she says she can’t — the two cities balance each other. L.A. gives her space and calm; New York gives her spontaneity and chaos. She wants to stay bicoastal as long as she can.

Living in two places also means doubling everyday objects. Park owns two identical teapots, one in each city, because they’re part of her morning tea ritual. In May, the New York teapot slipped from her hand and shattered, breaking the symmetry. She plans to order another one soon.
