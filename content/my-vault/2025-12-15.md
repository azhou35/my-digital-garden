- 🔴Node Telemetry
	- Things we can’t get ourselves from VMs
- 🔴Switch Telemetry 
	- Requires getting data from side-band channels
    



**

MOST OF OUR Fleet we try to get most of we can 
make sure we chat with frontiers but also understand what our outcomes are here and each dimension
- nvl72 rma 
	- 
- telemetry
	- node / switch telemetry story 
	- how can we get this data
	- what do we use this data for 
	- how do build automations to action upon this 
	- how can we be proactive rather than reactive

frontier's goal is to be hand-holdy 
our goal is to be out of our hands 


apollo for frontiers cluster

invest in automation for maintenance ops
- oci side 

centralize all these into next
- uild a site ops portal 
- where we provide site ops - on call people
- ability to do stuff

anybody from the tema to try out 
connecting to ndb 
cain is very open 


most should be automation 95%
3% for site ops 
1 1/2 % manual 

- can we get a list of the racks in phx62 colo2 or colo4? dc team should have a list of racks / a map, but we'll need someone like girish or a dev to translate that into which racks this corresponds to for us
- can we align this with other impactful maintenances - anything across switch/hostos/hca
- what are the risks here - what happens if we delay this, what could go wrong, etc
