- calcium 
	- could be workloads / ib 


## Scheduling 
- make this a bot
Surface utilization metrics (for constrained regions / SKUs) for maintenance operators to reason about real constraints.
Provide quota specs for which workloads are on cluster, SKU/region specifications, etc 
Achieved via Simon/Peter’s scripts
- all these engine moves take stuff out of global buffer
- kevin park plans w a 5% buffer
	- but it doesnt help with a constraint
	- operational buffer w constaraints 
constraints:
- SKU 
- Sausage link
- Provider
- Region
- size of blocks of GPUs (256 GPUs - needs to be the same GPU to be contiguous)
Engine Cluster:
- Three quotas awe want to add capacity re pinned to Denton 
- If we cant solve, workloads cant move out 
- If research 
	- ok
- If applied
	- way worse
- When we move it we want to minimize what eles we change 
	- Triggers fewer moves 
- What is the ideal # of engine moves?
	- Expensive only 
		- If there's some inconsistencies for bring up it causes Product pain/support pain
	- If consistent 
		- THings should work 
- Even if u take out one cluster and try to backfill it 
	- It tries to optimize for everything 
	- A lot of scenarios when quota solve is blocked
	- If we need to bump chat quota 
- W maintenance u want to take minimal 

we have maintenance alerts/ vs 
nodes have certain priorities and ned to be actioned


node 1:
- information logged in database
- this is for this node whats wrong 
- failure information
- when was it detected
- when is maintenance defined 
- want to se a node and see any of its issues
- what type of issue it was
- its priority
- and any maintenance events
- is the maintenance going to happen
- is it hard start date 
- these nodes have a failure and we should move off of them 
is this what go/next does? 
- we would want to use the info from a scheduling pov 
- instead of marking a node as cordoned and its either cordoned or not 
- you can set a maintenance event from today from two weeks from now 
	- action these 12 hours ahead of time 
- if we change the maintenance scope/cluster we just update that events
