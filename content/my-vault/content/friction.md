(insert anecdote on friction).

the first time my mom taught me to make mantou, she insisted we knead the dough by hand. no roller, no mixer, just the delicate palms of care cupping the pockets of sticky dough. when i sunk my fingers into the soft mound and pushed my weight downwards, i felt a light resistance. *the dough needs to feel the resistance*, she explained. 

these days, i crave the light sweetness of chinese bread. sometimes i don't even need to leave my apartment - a touch of a button and a uber courier is on its way. a handy popup on the button suggests a multitude of bubble teas i can one-click add to my order. technology companies optimize for frictionless experiences every step of the user journey - reducing waiting times and click times.

but the human brain was not designed to ingest such fast-paced rewards system for instant gratification. we've evolved to numb ourselves from resistance & choose the shortest path at all times. 

technology companies optimize for frictionless experiences, but what if this removal of resistance is actually diminishing the weight and meaning of our creations and connections? By intentionally reintroducing productive friction into our processes, we might recover the depth that comes from struggle, patience, and imperfection.

rather than avoid friction: *lean into it.*

the natural state of physics is to take the path of least resistance. but resistance is what sparks energy to convert into other forms: resistance in a light bulb creates light, in a toaster creates heat, and in a speaker creates sound. unnecessary friction can disrupt flow - but it can also cause meaningful state changes that solidify your ideas from vapor to tangibles. creative friction generates meaningful outcomes through transformation of energy.

there used to be inherent learning curves to any creative pursuit. and in favor of equitibility + democraticizing access to the arts, we've also made the rubicon to cross too shallow for pursuits: *painting, coding, video editing.*

instead of five mole hills i want to find the mountain to tackle. 

we've become emotionally numb to delay. a dream deferred is not a dream is not a dream festering & stinking & crusting - it's a willingness to want something that takes hard work and conviction.

cognitive load theory: mental effort is necessary for deep learning. we understand a lossy view of the world when it's fed to us via chatbot conversations and google searches. 

the classical physics theory is that applying force to something that generates friction results in the most kinetic energy. this month i'm attempting to identify things that generate this friction - where are the ideas that puzzle me? what manifests in discomfort? if my brain were a rubber band, 

is it a coincidence that a part of flirting on the first date is *tension*? the playful banter, as two souls navigate what is acceptable to poke fun at, as you're searching for differences as much as similarities because it's the incongruousness that makes you compatible.

patience, deliberation, and sitting with the unknown were key unlocks to human creation in the past. (insert examples of ppl who had revelations from watching wallpaper peel off).

>"**AI now promises results without the reckoning, but frictionless creation leads to weightless rewards.** No one dreams of merely pushing a button to generate their magnum opus. The output matters, but the intention, the struggle, the care is what makes it count —what gives it weight.[2](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/make-something-heavy#footnote-2-158538641)"



ai chatbots are a fine conversator for ideas - but imagine talking to a friend who only ever hypes you up. i spitball claude some side project ideas and it always responds positively - *great idea! let me show you how to implement it.*

write about things that will make you uncomfortable - there's a psychological richness in discomfort. what manifests in discomfort? if my brain were a rubber band, 
instead of blindly pursuing convenience, what if we proactive reintroduce friction into our lives? writing a first draw with pen and paper. write about things that will make you uncomfortable - there's a psychological richness in discomfort. taking the longer route to a destination outside of google maps. 

we need the negative rewards signals as much as the positive, the bite as much as the drive.


there's a leap of faith you make when you take on a heavy project. many things are uncertain: how tough the journey will be, how fulfilling it'll be to you, the feedback from other people

the path of least resistance





use friction as a forcing function to convert your potential into action.
