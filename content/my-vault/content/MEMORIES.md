how have we not even attempted to crack memory? 


memory used to be the way that we tell story from generation to generat

"who you are is not something that is efficient or trackable by metrics
its a collection of experiences memories reflections relationships all bunch of things lived in relation to a story you have about yourself"

we need something that makes suffering coherent -> a story

to have a story that is so meaningful to you that it lives inside your memories, to be able to recall a story from memory and tell other people around you

when you close your eyes and imagine your most vivid memory, what do you see? 

sepia tones bleeding into the edges of my vision. perhaps the most durable portals to my past are not the pictures rotting away in my gphotos drive. 
it's finding the old cards my friends have left me. 
stifling through my math papers and the doodles that carried throughout. 

lost time memory 
our photos hyperdimensional, our memories are not 
memories blur together 
photos are exact and tractable
but they cannot capture the emotions of a moment. they dont always get the colors right. the feeling correct. 

there are no pixels in how i remember things. you can't box it into four dimensions, it extends past the four walls. 

technology:

- fb memory 
- snapchat/iphotos memories - they resurface photos of you from high school arbitrarily, in an attempt to mimic the casual recall.
iphone doesnt sell a phone it sells a time machine to another self 

chatgpt has enduring memory

my most vivid memories are still from childhood. the kids tending to onion in the grass. the time my neighbor accidentally broke down my closet door. 

*all water has perfect memory *

what is the shape of your memory? 

remember rolling down the grass. 


how does memory work for ai models?
info is stored in the background - allows you to have context about other people 
lost time memory 
what would we do if we outsourced memory / context to another tool?
- we do it thru crms
- through contact books
- or we look at someones IG to recall them
- humans have lossy memory
'A memory is a re-creation, _precio_us because it is both more and less than the original.'

memory is not stored away in the distance ec2 servers of a fb account. 
it's the handwriting on my father's letter the day i graduated middle school. it's x y z. it's proof that something was alive and had meant something in the real world. 
memory is ephemeral, memory escapes us, memory resists a container. 

memory is a classical computer science primitive: the physical hardware that stores data and instructions for immediate access by the CPU. a better term would be *storage*

it’s funny how when i look back, details-faces-names blend together. all that’s left are the filtered feels. i don’t remember what i was mad about, just that i was mad. sepia-toned sadness seeps into worn photos of estranged friends. prismatic joy pulsates from . i reread forgotten love letters scrawled on notebook paper
Chang: memory “isn’t something that blooms, but something that bleeds internally.” [from description: it is willed, summoned, and dragged to the surface.

“Memory is everything, yet it is nothing. Memory is mine, but it is also clinging to the memory of others.”

Julia creet: maybe memory is where we have arrived rather than where ew have left.

these liquid memories spill out without a second thought. at times it’s hard to visualize the exact setting or world i allude to: i just see a hazy scene, like a movie set, where the world is set up for that moment and nothing else.

 feel more honest when I tell you stories in bits and pieces. Memory is a broken thing, and I am not very good at forcing…](https://www.aliciakennedy.news/p/on-memories-as-fragments?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)


maybe a better question - if you could choose perfect memory, would you say yes? 

today i ask people about their favorite summer memories. it's fun to see what they say: some list artifacts - fruit of their childhood, others describe recent trips they've taken to europe and the like.
