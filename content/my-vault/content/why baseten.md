* researching gpu platforms for contrary research -> found out thru sarah guo's grey matter podcast -> dug into for work / personal interest -> 

The past few years I've been working at AI infrastructure and hyperscalers and become far too attuned to the cumbersome nature of scaling AI workloads. I would hop on calls with research customers and find and developers were spending more time fighting with infrastructure than actually doing their cool AI work.

I've seen the power of supercomputing first hand but also the stopgaps from making them useful in production. After diving into ML inference platforms for Contrary research, I came across Tuhin Srivastava's podcast with Sarah Guo and came away with the mission that *speed is key* when it comes to making AI viable at scale. 

Ever since that pod, I've been diving into LLM frameworks, experimenting wtih different inference platforms, and I remain convinced baseten is the most intuitive and powerful to use. It's clear the team found the perfect balance between upholding high standards for their design while also iterating quickly. I want to work at a company that holds a POV, and baseten's opinionated nature on the new future of infrastructure and open-source paragims they want to build is highly compelling. 

I want to be at the forefront of whwat unlocks the power of AI across industries, and I confidently believe that comes with the democratization of infrastructure through tools like baseten. I want to work on the hairiest problems with the most ambitious people, and baseten feels like a perfect catalyst.


The interdisciplinary nature of this role lends well to my own background: a mixture of customer-facing engagement, product-minded thinking to surface customer pain points, and quick prototyping. I'm looking for a role where i straddle the realms of the inscrutable and the explainable, constantly communicating and iterating on ideas with the customer in order to deliver real business value. 

From my roles spanning technical writing to product management, the magic has always been chatting with the customer and seeing their faces light up when we explain and prototype something that solves their dire needs. In tandem with sales and research teams, I led an end-to-end sprint to prototype a multi-agent Copilot that would reduce the friction HPC researchers had when using our platform for their genomics workflows, accelerating their time to execution. I want to take this experience and work directly on the face that baseten delivers values to their customers: making their time to deployment faster. 

I constantly research and write about the industry trends on the side, spearheading internal company newsletters as well as my public-facing ones. From publishing technical blogs, amassing over 15k views to foster heightened product awareness and to leading benchmarking for Azure GPU and CPU product suite, collecting comprehensive data to establish performance capabilities, determine usability and maintain program alignment, I've seen the power of communication in explaining the impact of the product. I truly believe the magic in being able to translate the highly technical to a diverse audience, and this an opportunity to lead that charter for baseten. 

effectively communicating the strategic benefits of AI and HPC workload optimizations on Azure  



Working within a big company's AI/HPC infrastructure team, I saw firsthand how complicated GPU infrastructure can get. Every time teams wanted to scale their AI workloads, it was like navigating this crazy maze of compute resources and scheduling. Researchers and developers were spending more time fighting with infrastructure than actually doing their cool AI work.

Deploying models through Baseten gives me the same magic feeling when I discovered Jupyter notebooks for the first time in high school: the real magic happens when you remove all the technical friction. Through my career working with customers I've been all about empowering them to get to solving their own problems as fast as possible. When smart people can just focus on their ideas instead of wrestling with infrastructure, that's when innovation really takes off. And that's exactly what you're building.


What excites me about this role is the perfect blend of customer engagement, product thinking, and technical implementation. I thrive at the intersection of the inscrutable and the explainable—translating complex technical capabilities into tangible customer value.

Throughout my career, the most rewarding moments have come from seeing customers' faces light up when we demonstrate solutions to their critical challenges. At Microsoft, I led a sprint with sales and research teams to prototype a multi-agent Copilot that significantly reduced friction for HPC researchers using our platform for genomics workflows. When smart people can just focus on their ideas instead of wrestling with infrastructure, that's when innovation really takes off.  I'm eager to bring this experience to Baseten to accelerate customers' time to deployment.

My passion extends to communicating technical concepts effectively. I've published technical blogs and machine learning tutorials, spearheaded company newsletters, and led benchmarking for Azure's GPU and CPU suite to establish performance capabilities. I believe in the power of translating highly technical concepts for diverse audiences—a skill I'm excited to bring to Baseten as the team continues to grow and educate the market on your innovative platform.

I also believe this role directly aligns with the value proposition of baseten: by quickly iterating with customers, I'm excited to directly accelerate time to market for teams who want to leverage LLMs.
