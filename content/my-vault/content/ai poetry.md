[[ai poetry]]
internet people prefer slop due to a lack of discernment
- “Fundamental: Humans cannot evaluate performance on difficult tasks well”, and since evaluating a poem is inherently difficult and takes time, or at least requires a background that most people don’t have, it’s tough for RLHFers to reward good poetry.


As we discussed earlier, AI poems do not reward further study. They don’t invite reflection, allow for complexity, or problematize the act of representing the world — the act of mimesis that art is and must struggle with.

That might actually be the experience of those who have already latently and implicitly developed their poetics, but it’s unhelpful

element. Not _novelty_, in the sense of like a poem that lacks the letter 'e' — rather the "charm of lyric", as Vendler writes

There is no, as yet, [move 37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_37) moment that I've observed. There's rarely a time when an AI lyric surprises me in the deep sense that the best human poems do. When they are clear, they are boring. When they are not — as DeepSeek-R1's have a habit of being — they don't transcend, but rather just fail to make sense.
seems like there is no "_there_ there"; it seems that _I_, the reader, am the one doing the primary work, above and beyond the base rate of the contribution of reader-response in literature. We might call this by the loaded word "authenticity".

I think the sturdiest objection to (one-shot) AI art is one that claims, a priori, that it can never be authentic. That — authenticity — is what I feel most missing from AI poetry. This argument would go something like this:

1. Art requires the transformation of genuine experience (through many choices).

2. AI models can never, even in theory, have genuine experience.

3. Therefore AI models can't make art.
