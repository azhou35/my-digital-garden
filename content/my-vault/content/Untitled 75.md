Hi Annie,

We would like to move forward with next steps!  
  
Please input  **your availability (multiple days/times) for a 45 minute virtual interview through this link:** [https://you.ashbyhq.com/meeting/7855c8ee-d04b-4e9c-912a-3b2beacb3dc0/](https://you.ashbyhq.com/meeting/7855c8ee-d04b-4e9c-912a-3b2beacb3dc0/)

Once you've submitted your availability, our amazing partner, Mariah, will send you a separate email confirmation!  
  
**Project Retrospective (45 min)**  
This interview will be a project deep dive where we’ll ask you to walk a member of our team through a technical project you led or contributed to, including the context/motivation, key architecture decisions, impact, learnings, how you handled risks, created alignment and the impact that the program and your contributions to it had. **Please prepare a few slides as the format for this presentation.**  
  
In general, we're looking for evidence of the following:

- Ability to define clear, appropriate goals based on business and product context
    
- Ability to devise and implement strong, thoughtful technical solutions to complex problems, from high-level architecture to key implementation details
    
- Communication, about technical topics as well as product/business/organizational context
    
- Programs experience and execution path. How did you push things forward and execute at high bar
    
- Walk through technical project or program. Slides or visuals would be great. Dive into technical details AND execution map. What was YOUR contribution?
    
- Show architectural diagrams
    
- Create frameworks and structure and showcase you were in the weeds and your involvement
    
- Need to showcase driving the programs end to end
    

Best,
