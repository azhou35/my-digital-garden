title: "software vs hardware"
---

[[my relationship with my job]]
[[february 2025 work logs]]

The tension: my team is led by heavy-weights in hardware and the software experience is minimized.

I want to investigate what happens when we full-throttle in hardware and leave software behind:
1. Specific software gaps which in turn limit hardware utilization
2. Which companies have software+hardware vs hardware-only approach?
3. What are the customer needs beyond raw hardware (management tools, integrations, automations)
4. Is software a must-have or a nice-to-have? 
5. Which company models successfully balance software/hardware invesetment


Pain points i've had in my job:
* Sometimes hardware breaks and software doesn't detect it correctly -> financial losses
	* e.g. we went out of 95% NIS bc a node was mistakenly reported missing 
* What is the point of Azure as a middleman between NVIDIA and OAI
	* If SW updates depend on NV, and if OAI only wants to use us for Hardware in Baremetal, what's the point in us 
* Justifying w operational excellence is important
	* Quantifiable business impact of software delays AND software problems on hardware deployment
		* EG for GB200 even tho HW is ready VMs are not there


#### Competitive Advantage of Software Bundling
1. GPU Software examples
	1. optimize resource allocation
	2. dynamic scaling
	3. workload-specific fine-tuning

*Would it take longer for customers be productive w bare metal vs software-managed GPUs?*
Enthusiasts buy random gpus 
*What is the ML engineer workflow need beyond raw compute? What is the pain points working w GPUs directly vs having management layers*

### Market Evolution of GPUs
From gaming hardware / specialized hardware with limited applications -> internal GPU use for AI applications (MSR) -> selling GPU capacity to external companies -> established Value Prop w Cruise but revealed challenges in GPU scaling -> GPU demand
