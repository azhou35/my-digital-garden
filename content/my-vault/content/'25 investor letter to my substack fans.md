forked from [[2025 reflection]]

in the golden age of youtube 2015-2020, i looked forward to each year's *youtube rewind* - where they brought together the most iconic youtubers (e.g. smosh pewdiepie nigahiga) into a massive skit. at some point youtube's yearly rewind diverged into a glorified top ten list. right now every app in the world is producing a "yearly wrapped" - so much so ive even made my own - and it feels like a year is just captured in bits and bytes. 

here are some of my cultural observations of the hashtag algorithm.

authenticity/authentication in 2025 

### 1. authorship - death of the author

annie is dead and i have killed her 

the author has been lost long before the disruption of ai. the buzzfeed-ification of blogging in the 2010s indicated we wanted writing forcefed to us in easy chunks. we bemoan ai-generated music, yet the top tunes on tik tok have been filtered through so many layers of production companies and algorithms that we're already missing the human in the loop. 

my voice has a certain lilt to it, uneasy and uncertain. 

#### 2. performance

2025 was the year of performative males, bemoaning the persona who holds tote bags and drinks matcha. i found this trend quite peculiar - isn't all a life a performance? i buy a polene purse to indicate quiet luxury. 

am i living my life or am i watching it via screen?

we've lost the casual hang. i hit 0.1% of users of partiful and still struggle to think of who to invite to my birthday. what was life before partiful, before we had a metric of "# of events hosted" to hit? we host activities to avoid participation, to avoid feeling. 

narrative is everything and narrative is nothing. as byung chul han says, "in our contemporary information society, where everything has become arbitrary and random, storytelling becomes storyselling and narratives lose their binding force." 

#### 3. slop / branding
in 2025 personal branding abound - the tik tok girlies got hold of substack, everyone makes a tik tok account for their hobbies. at the same time brands have gone the individual route - claude and gemini uses influencers to champion their newest ai model. 

there's a convergence between individual and consumer brand into a singular entity on the internet. bereal got backlash when brands could start posting their daily posts as ads - linkedin and reddit both hide sponsored ads as app-native posts that just so happen to be espousing their favorite brand. 

as ai increases the floor for creative production, we need to also raise the floor. otherwise we get squeezed by the messy middle. democratization of a gated skill always has two effects - it improves distribution and accessibility but it also floods the market with lower quality work. 

the cinematic trend of 2024 has swelled and exploded: everyone is turning their life into a 30 day challenge. we've casually superimposed serif fonts over our images and videos. i want to create art, yes - but who gets to do so? 
#### 4. authentication
it's july ** needed to rebook a flight to sf last minute. 30 minutes into a support call with an agent, i get so frustrated i start crying. the guy on the other end, presumably someone outsourced to a third-world country, pauses and says a canned statement: hello miss i understand you must be upset.. 

the screen asks me if im human and i scoff, and then ask, *well am i really human anymore?*

i fear that i've lost critical thought, that all my ideas are derivative of another.

i constantly get flagged as an agent whenever i try to dm someone on twitter. i try their stupid authentication system and it feels like a puzzling mindgame. every silicon valley startup is stuffing agentic somewhere in their public speak, and in my interview prep i pore over the ideas of authentication and api calling.

in high school i studied the *turing test* and with little fanfare we've leapfrogged it. i'd litter my gchats with idiosyncracies as my personal style - tildles and emoticons and stars. rip to my fav punctuation mark the *em dash,* which enabled many a run-away sentence. 

2025 was the year of *agents* - aka every company had rewritten their code-speak to shoehorn this key term, and startups raised capital at the promise of integrating this in every which vertical. 

what is the future of authentication come the agentic layer of the internet? when interactions go from human to human to human to agent, to eventually agent to agent? 

authenticity, as described in existentialism, is the "degree to which a person's actions are congruent with their with their values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity." a lack of authenticity is to act in *bad faith *with one's self.  

at the end of the day i remain techno-optimist. this matters to me because humans are already flawed at grappling with their interior identity, and digital abstractions have given us yet another mask to escape our true innerworkings. but maybe it takes something deeply disruptive - the panopticon of tik tok, the enshittification of media - to really highlight that the writing was on the wall all along. maybe we need a bubble to burst to know it was swelling in the first place.
