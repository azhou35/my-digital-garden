title: "reflections on roles at startups"
---

*october 2025*

from my experience recruiting from march - september. 
i received 4 job offers 
i knew i fit in the profile of someone "technical but not a pure software engineer" - which is difficult to slot into early-stage startups

here is what i saw hiring:
1) forward deployed/deployment strategist 
	1) first spearheaded by the deployment engineer at palantir, this role reseats a technical integrator to directly interface with customer in order to build custom solutions for their workflows. it's a unique blend of sales, engineering, consulting. 
	2) they range across a spectrum of how technical they are (are you writing code or just setting up an existing product?) as well as where in the sales pipeline they fit (pre-sales, post-sales, etc)
	3) related readings: [Sorry, that isn't an FDE - by Ted Mabrey - Ted’s Substack](https://tedmabrey.substack.com/p/sorry-that-isnt-an-fde)  
2) strategy & ops
	1) another nebulous role that boils down to the internal mechanics of a company that keep it running. there's an internal and external flair: one that leans more finance, hr, data analysis; another that leans more customer focused. some ops roles sit very closely with the product team, which is what i was attracted to. 
	2) ultimately i felt like they're geared for ex-consultants/bankers with demonstrated spreadsheet savvy. that isn't to discount any other experience, but what i found reflected in interviews were typically case studies and spreadsheet exercises.
	3) i'd take a look at the company and see how core ops is to their bottom line - are they within a domain that is particularly ops heavy? how do you interact with the rest of the company? is there a plan to take advantage of ai-based labor disruption?

3) gtm
	1) not something i super recruited for 
4) pm/tpm 
	1) as a (non-exhaustive) rule of thumb, these roles tend to crop up after a company has found pmf (post series c)
