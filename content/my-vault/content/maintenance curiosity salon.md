the maintenance of everything

### intro
lately we've been pretty interested in building 
-> but what about maintaining?

corrosion control was skipped to save money. Engineers knew corrosion inhibitors were required. Small savings produced irreversible harm
### case study - america 
**maintenance of cars**
![[Pasted image 20260103140132.png]]
*maintenance requires a design philosophy*
in *stewart brand maintenance philosophy* - there were three 3 approaches to designing for maintenance
1) the ford model T won out 
	1) cars were cheap, simple, standardized
	2) **key were interchaneable parts**
		1) repairs cheaper than repair labor
		2) users expected to maintain / modify their own vehicle 
	3) examine cultural fascination with owning and taking care of ones car
	4) user innovation 
	5) to maintain is to tinker 
		1) this extends to personal computers, the itnernet, any open system
**a dream deferred**
**NYC Subway (electrical infrastructure)**

- **77 of 224 substations** are rated “poor or marginal.”
- Some substations are **60+ years old**.
- At the Harlem substation:
    - Equipment overheats so badly that **cold water is continuously pumped through pipes** to keep it from failing.
    - When voltage spikes, **arcs of electricity shoot from circuit breakers**, spraying molten copper onto walls.
- A **single substation failure can delay 30+ trains** within minutes.
-  Infrastructure-related delays now occur **every 3 minutes and 12 seconds**.
- Three years earlier, delays happened **every 5 minutes and 7 seconds**.
- That’s a **46% increase** in delay frequency in just a few years.
**Why the subway is uniquely hard to fix**
we demand reliability and cannot tolerate breaks
- It **cannot shut down overnight**.
- Repairs must be done:
    - Between trains
    - At night
    - Under live electrical systems
- Priority is “keep trains running,” not “fix things correctly.”
## 3. Maintenance backlogs grow because accounting hides them

**Public infrastructure in the U.S.**
- Over **$1 trillion** in deferred maintenance nationwide.
- Roads and bridges alone account for **$100B+**.
- Water systems leak **~6 billion gallons per day** of treated, pumped, paid-for water.
**Concrete takeaway:**  
Maintenance debt forces operators into _permanent emergency mode_, relying on cooling tricks and constant monitoring instead of replacement.
### invisible labor
**Signal inspectors**
- Work on active roadbeds near live trains and electricity.
- Diagnose failures ranging from **broken cables** to **computer-controlled signal faults**.
- Preventive maintenance keeps systems alive — but happens underground, at night, out of sight.
    
**Cleaners*
- Remove human waste from trains.
- Some workers reported **months without access to bathrooms or lunch areas**.
- Subway disinfection alone costs **~$300M/year**.
    

**Maintenance facilities**
- Westchester Locomotive Shop: 
    - Heaters failed.
    - Interior temperatures dropped to **32–40°F**.
    - All repair work halted.


### case study - japan

### 1. Maintenance is continuous, visible, and professional

- Railways operate on the expectation of constant wear.
    
- Maintenance workers are **career professionals**, not temporary or disposable labor.
    
- Their roles are named, legible, and respected (設備保全／メンテナンス作業員).
    
- Preventable breakdowns carry **social shame**, not acceptance.

### 2. Maintenance is ritualized, not improvised

- The Shinkansen’s **“7-minute miracle”**:
    
    - Trains are unloaded, cleaned, inspected, and restocked in a tightly choreographed sequence.
        
    - Each worker has a precise role; the process is public and repeatable.
        
- Upkeep is treated as a performance of reliability, not backstage labor.

### 3. Policy has shifted from building new to caring for existing

- Japan once invested heavily in new expressways.
    
- Today, budgets increasingly prioritize **maintenance and asset preservation**.
    
- Municipalities like **Ichinomiya City** focus on managing what already exists rather than expanding indefinitely.

### 4. Maintenance extends into everyday life and objects

- Repair is culturally normalized and even aestheticized:
    
    - _Kintsugi_ makes repair visible rather than hiding damage.
        
- Craftspeople specialize in upkeep: knife sharpening, shoe repair, clothing mending.
    
- Appliances come with:
    
    - Explicit maintenance instructions
        
    - Service schedules
        
    - Long-term manufacturer support

### 5. Underlying philosophy

Maintenance is:

- **Visible** (not hidden)
    
- **Ritualized** (not ad hoc)
    
- **Respected** (not devalued)
    
- **Culturally legible** (understood by everyone)
    

This reflects broader values of _kaizen_ — continuous, incremental improvement — where care is a sign of seriousness, not inefficiency.

### One-line synthesis you can reuse

> In Japan, maintenance is not a cost to minimize or a failure to hide — it is a visible, professional, and culturally respected practice that assumes systems endure only through constant care.
