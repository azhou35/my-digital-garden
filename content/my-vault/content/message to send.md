for context: im late to submitting a rewrite on their snorkel ai memo. i've written three memos and only collected thorough feedback on the first, which is supposed to be pubbed soon. i joined in may 2024? so it's been more than a couple months. 
- idk if i should just suck it up and hand in the rewrite and continue until my first memo gets published
- idk if i should ask to pause or if i should stop it completely 
- idk if they need all this lip service or if i should be to the point 
Hey Jennifer,

Sorry for the late response -- could I take the week to wrap up the Snorkel AI Rewrite? 
I also wanted to discuss my time commitment for the Research Fellowship. Due to heightened commitments for work I wanted either pause or halt my participation in it. I learned a lot through the process of researching, synthesizing, and writing about the latest startups, and I'm grateful for the feedback and time the team has spent on my memos and rewrites. Please let me know what the next steps would be to offboard as a Fellow.
