[[her in 2025]]
Thesis: 
*as we rush to automate human connection through AI, we simultaneously cling to physical artifacts of intimacy.*


as a kid i loved my friends' birthday parties - not for the festivities but for a chance to crack open my scrapbooking kit and make them a homemade card. id walk down the aisles of cvs for inspiration and giggle at the cheesy ones with princesses and bears and the millenial memes, over-confident in my ability to execute better. 

i believed in the craft of cards as much as any 10-year old could - folding construction paper and doodling rabbits and birthday cakes and pouring my heart out via barely legible chicken scratch.  

it's 2025 and i blearily type a "happy birthday !!" message when a facebook notification nudges me. for my birthday, my dad sends me a video via wechat messager. it's a compilation of old photos, but he's used pika to make myself sing happy birthday. 

it's incredibly fitting that the movie *her* was set in 2025. we're living in the future that spike jonze envisioned. no edges, only curved corners. pink and coral hues punctured by algorithmic blue light. isn't it so ironic that one of the first things to be automated away was human intimacy?


the art of note-giving is sacred to me

maybe it's because of that i'm so amused by the irony within movies like *her*. in 2025, the main character's whole job is to write greeting cards for others. the world within *her* is a world with no edges, only curved corners. pink and coral hues punctured by algorithmic blue light. isn't it so ironic that the first thing to be automated away was human intimacy, but artifacts of human connection remain? 
a deep romantic inspired by the likes of *tatbilb*, i wrote childhood flames love letters on notebook paper that surely got crumpled up in the middle of their physics binders. 

to this day, i preserve this practice, tracing silly lil cursive lines on notes in intelligible handwriting.



### outsourcing vulnerability 

one time a friend was breaking up with her boyfriend (important: over snapchat) and handed her phone to me to stake the final nail in the coffin. chatgpt could generate a query instantaneously but i buffered, drowning in overthinking on what someone could say. empathy overdrive - as much as i had to put myself in her shoes, i'd also had to imagine his reaction as well.

at the same time i was writing physical cards as a kid, i still was a child of the internet. in a suburban community with no ability to meet people in person, i developed intimacy online - google chat group chats, google doc chat rooms, video game entry rooms, eventually, discord.

### handwriting 

in 2025 - the same year depicted in 'Her' - we find ourselves in a peculiar moment where AI can replicate the language of intimacy. yet it lacks the embodied vulnerability that makes human connection meaningful. Our continued attachment to physical tokens of connection - handwritten notes, vinyl records, film photos - reveals what's missing from digital intimacy: the beautiful imperfections of human touch.

for my birthday, i received several cards. and i embrace the cheesiness of it all - a space to reflect on your friendship and reference all the silly hangs that you've gone on together. i love seeing what are the first things my friends come up with when they think of *me*. it's the way shirling writes my note in the shape of a tea bag and stepho doodles a chicken on the card. i think its the *details* that get me.

* Intro: child making greeting cards
* 2025 - we're living in the future *her* imagined
* What's missing here?
	* AI can't leave if it was never there for you. Vulnerability and trust
* Startups: howcan technology help us understand emotions? new vocab for understanding human connection? in the process of trying we're seeing how sophisticated something as evolutionarily emergent as human connection is 
	* Cartesia AI's programmatic manipulation of emotional expression
	* Hume AI: semantic space theory to map human emotions - trying to predict and respond to emotional needs
* Conclusion: We don't just want the words themselves - we want the intangibles, the physical fact that someone reached out
* End: making zines for vday
