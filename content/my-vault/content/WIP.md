We’re looking for Works in Progress article pitches. We are especially interested in pieces about:

- The history of how states developed effective institutions and built state capacity, plus ways to improve governance and state capacity in developed countries today.
    
- Ways to safely reduce the total cost of nuclear power and other forms of clean energy.
    
- Geo-engineering: could we slow global warming with sulphur dioxide? 
    
- Ideas, especially ones already successful somewhere, to make it easier for people to have kids. 
    
- Megaprojects: How can we reclaim Dogger Bank from the sea or extend Manhattan? How were other megaprojects done successfully and quickly?
    
- Metascience: how people have improved the practice of science in the past, or created effective research organizations.
    
- Crime and anti-social behavior: clever ways to make society friendlier and safer.
    
- Consumer surplus, or how lifestyle technologies have improved.
    
- Plus our main focuses: housing, infrastructure, global health, and important advances in science and technology.
- We are interested in a wide range of article types. Some of our best articles have been journalism about breakthroughs in science and technology, like Stephan Guyenet’s [early piece on the effectiveness of GLP-1 agonists](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-future-of-weight-loss/) like semaglutide, and Hiawatha Bray’s on [the many uses for silk](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-future-of-silk/). 

One of our pieces is a ‘how to’ – Nan Ransohoff’s [guide to creating an advance market commitment](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-to-start-an-advance-market-commitment/). Another is a diary: Keller Scholl’s [account of his time in a human challenge trial for Zika](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/life-in-the-time-of-zika/). Perhaps our most popular article ever, Stewart Brand’s [The Maintenance Race](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-maintenance-race/), is narrative non-fiction.

Some offer small ‘keyhole’ changes that might make significant improvements without a lot of political fuss. John Myers’s [case for nuclear federalism](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/taming-the-stars/) is one such example. 

The bulk of our pieces are analytical case studies, which look at a particular phenomenon in great detail and draw out the important lessons of that. This category includes Nick Cowen’s account of [how the norms that control crime are formed](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-the-war-on-drunk-driving-was-won/), using campaigns against drunk driving as a case study; Samuel Watling’s [history of British housing shrinkflation in the 1960s and 1970s](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/britains-forgotten-financial-crisis/); Brian Potter’s [story of the decline of cut and cover in tunnel building](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-stopped-building-cut-and-cover/); and Eleanor West and Marko Garlick’s [explanation of the massive half-success of upzoning in New Zealand](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/upzoning-new-zealand/).
