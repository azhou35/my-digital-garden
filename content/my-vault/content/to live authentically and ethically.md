authenticity is one of my personal values. 

"Existential thinkers like Kierkegaard and Sartre wrote extensively about authenticity and what it meant to be authentic. For them, authenticity meant living the life we were meant to live, living it according to our values and purpose, not the values of someone else."

authenticity, as described in existentialism, is the "degree to which a person's actions are congruent with their with their values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity." a lack of authenticity is to act in *bad faith *with one's self.
