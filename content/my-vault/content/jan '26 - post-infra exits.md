title: "jan '26 - post-infra exits"
---

i like working in ai infra. i don't think i'm an sme. 
i like tpm. i dont think this is the final end of my career.

what i see as my future is building hardware with inference models on-prem (via consumer products/robotics/embodied robotics).

why?
- this is a product-native question
	- you have to build something that is craftful and brings delight (like apple) while housing a powerhouse of a computer system
	- you have to design it to work well within a human's behavior, while ALSO guiding and informing what that behavior could look like 
- this builds on my exp in ai infra
	- i have deep expertise in gpu workloads, how to bring up and maintain a fleet, and coming up to speed on how to allocate gpus to the right inference applied products to sustain traffic. 
		- the latter is highly relevant for anything at scale 
- this is a systems-level, high impact field
	- if we can unlock the physical world there are so many interactions that are made possible 
bear case:
- consumer hardware is dead / EXTREMELY hard
