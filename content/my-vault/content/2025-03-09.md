post-skiing thoughts
hm i come off as very forlorn and sad 
i am quite sad that my weight grew

first film roll came back ! quite happpy!

interact applications will come out in august - what will change by then? how will a writing community evolve?
i feel guilty and regretful that i prevented nitin from going out to his party

"my personal thoughts and beliefs arent so unique anyways 
i stared at the abyss and the abyss stared back at me"

digital cosmos
growing narrative to human consciousness
technium - sum of human progress
