[[reboot application editor description]]
**What are 2 specific themes/beats you’re excited to cover for Reboot? Please list any relevant knowledge, expertise, or experience. (100-400 words)**  
We're looking for editors to bring novel and diverse perspectives to the group, so we welcome departures from "what Reboot usually does"—we don't want to limit ourselves to a specific ideology or style. 

1) Urbanism & exploration.
	1) interfaces in the world
	2) Network theory and how it manifests in cities
	3) Studying Urban Design in Copenhagen I became a student of Jane Gehl -- (check bear for your notes) City was designed for mobility, and how 
	4) Done data analysis projects on a lot of crowdsourcing apps (e.g. Yelp, Beli)
	5) Questions like: 
		1) Are apps like Beli inherently status-seeking? What is good taste? How does artifiically-driven consumer sentiment affect local businesses? How does Partiful shape our social circles? What is the art of truly crafting a "random" walk in the city?
		2) https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/nyregion/nyc-chinatown-signs.html
		3) **How does technology physically affect the cities & communities around us?** I studied data science and anthropology in college, as urban design in Copenhagen. Whether I was in Ithaca, Seattle, New York, Copenhagen, or even my small hometown in Jersey, technology has impacted my experience on a city. A
		4) A city evolves to meet the needs of a people -- and people's needs are constantly changing due to the breakneck speed of technology. From working on social for Corner, a social curation app, I'm intrigued by social apps that encourage city exploration (e)
		5) I also want to investigate how technology in the context of urban development  -- such as apple pay on subway stations, last-mile bike apps for micro-mobility, 
	6) City design -- 
		1) What's the future of micro-mobility in cities? This project examines public transportation in different cities, examining bike-sharing and scooter-sharing data and how it affects the lifestyles of different people—males, females, commuters, students, etc—and how success of these services depend on these demographics. It also shows how city infrastructure evolves to support bikes—e.g. the bike lanes & space for bikers in Copenhagen vs New York City. As a tangent, this project could explore how men vs women navigate a city, as research shows men and women have different needs for public transportation ([https://datapopalliance.org/gender-data-series-mobility-accessibility-and-the-gender-data-gap-in-urban-transportation-planning/](https://datapopalliance.org/gender-data-series-mobility-accessibility-and-the-gender-data-gap-in-urban-transportation-planning/)).
2) Language, cognition, technology
	1) My personal prose & poetry work is driven by the crisis of individualism and authenticity and how it will be affected by the notion of LLMs. Self-making in the age of the internet. As an avid poet and prose writer, the *meaning* of words 
	2) AI has sparked a linguistics battle and I want to document it.  as a way of encoding meaning in LLMs 
	3) Can AIs make poetry? 
		1) concept of a metaphor is powerful -- it holds the way we think
	how can an llm interpret and understand metaphors?
	can it generate effective metaphors on its own? 
	* metaphor -> conceptual 
	* a metaphorical concept structures what we do and how we understand
	* essence of he metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of things in terms of another
	* human thought processes are largely metaphorical
		* now how do we quantify an abstrac idea?
* conduit metaphor: speaker puts ideas into words and sends them to a hearer who takes the idea out of words 
	4) Linguistics/socio-cultural POV on the implications of LLM, especially multilinguialism. 
	5) I even want to examine the metaphors used to describe technology. The danger of referring to "the algorithm," ([The Cathedral of Computation - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-cathedral-of-computation/384300/)), the history of metaphors we use to refer to AI (black box, neural network, ) [The Algorithm: Idiom of Modern Science (princeton.edu)](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/algorithm.html)
	6) Experience: worked on a data-vis team fighting the covid infodemic, intent on 
	7) I think theme would manifest in the way that I approach any piece (particularity on the deeper meaning of it all) 
	8) Love to dive deep into neural translation and how it can surface cognitive biases 
3) 


**What are 2 headlines for pieces or events you could see yourself producing? Why is each interesting to you? (100-400 words)**  

An editor's core responsibility is to produce one "piece" for Reboot every 3 months, driving it from ideation to execution. That could look like writing a short story, commissioning and editing an essay, recording a podcast, or producing an event. While we've often focused on essays, we welcome other expressive mediums.
Possible ideas:
1) "I Love my AI Girlfriend: "
	1) Every company is adding chatbots to their apps. Your mom u 
	2) story premise: 
		1) phantom accounts on facebook -- llms are trained on ghost accounts on social media 
	3) I'm drawn to science fiction the same way builders ae drawn to imagining the future -- it's a way to push the boundaries of the technology we have today, but within a thought experiment. As a result, it's the most visceral way of examining the consequences that AI could have on our relationships, societal structure, I love sci-fi because it centers the human amidst the chaos.
	4) writing a sci fi short story 
	5) sci fi x technology 
	6) events related 
	7) Everyone's trying to add copilots into their apps. Inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins of consumer technology ([Reid Hoffman’s 7 Deadly Sins Framework: Tech Analysis 101 | by Mike (Nongaap) | nongaap | Medium](https://medium.com/nongaap/reid-hoffmans-7-deadly-sins-framework-tech-analysis-101-cf7b76cdc8f8))Through a series of short stories, I want to pick a familiar app/technology and and tell a story where we push the AI capabilities to the extreme. The intent of these short stories is to examine the consequences that AI can have on our interpersonal relationships and social structure, as well as the ethical dilemmas that ensue in their efficiency. I'm inspired by humanist sci-fi by the likes of Ken Liu and Ted Chiang (think The Lifecycle of Software Objects), but at a cadence to match the breakneck speed of AI innovation today. 
2) Mimetic desire, algorithmic taste, and how it manifests in our city design.
	1) Analyze the layer of social curation apps intended to help consumers choose their next restaurant/activity/thing to do
		1) Case study: Yelp & Chinese restaurants 
		2) Case study: 
	2) Introduce the concept of mimetic desire (we want what other people want)
		1) How does this impact the way that restaurants position themselves? How does this affect foot traffic in a city or even desires to move cross city? 
	3) Next step: would love to bring this article outside of the laptop screen. Include interactive activities to reflect on your mimetic systems (e.g. reflect what restaurants you go to, why you go, who influences you)
		1) Run community events discussing the topic of the article, bringing in new ideas, seeing if there are other angles we can take at it 
	4) Imagine the algorithm/social app as a physical city. In a city, we wander, stroll, and gravitate towards crowds. An app is no different -- we scroll mindlessly and our interested is piqued when we see something popular.  
3) What's the future of micro-mobility in cities? This project examines public transportation in different cities, examining bike-sharing and scooter-sharing data and how it affects the lifestyles of different people—males, females, commuters, students, etc—and how success of these services depend on these demographics. It also shows how city infrastructure evolves to support bikes—e.g. the bike lanes & space for bikers in Copenhagen vs New York City. As a tangent, this project could explore how men vs women navigate a city, as research shows men and women have different needs for public transportation ([https://datapopalliance.org/gender-data-series-mobility-accessibility-and-the-gender-data-gap-in-urban-transportation-planning/](https://datapopalliance.org/gender-data-series-mobility-accessibility-and-the-gender-data-gap-in-urban-transportation-planning/)).
4) The Metaphors Within LLMs 
	1) 
	2) maybe something that includes the input of a lot of ppl
	3) i enjoy writing as a way to scale intellectual convos w friends -- expand this to reboot community 
	4) flywheel: publish post, discourse brunch it, maybe document the findings of discourse brunch 
	5) timely updates

**What are 2 samples of your past writing/creative work?**  
	1) edit this to be this
		1) [Copy of SP23 Reboot Article | Identity Formation in the Age of Digital Consumption - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wJ4QM-RNswfaqxZTLb0cQmNRtKzEWofa26uvwycFmeY/edit)
	2) edit your lost in translation piece?
		1) bring more of the ai
	3) try to write a short story either
		1) exploring what its like for a rizz bot to be made
		2) exploring someone working as a chatbot creator of people trying to speak to the dead
		3) "salons" a la 17th century french, modernized
			1) [Parisian Salons & the Enlightenment - World History Encyclopedia](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/2374/parisian-salons--the-enlightenment/)
		4) two people "in dialogue"

Links can be published online or uploaded to Google Drive. Ideally, samples are similar in style/format to the work you hope to do for Reboot. If you’ve written for Reboot or Kernel before, feel free to just use that.   

Your answer


---------------------------------------
why reboot:
* i feel the need to drive a project greater than myself via an art form i care about.  i think writing about tech is a great avenue for that. ive been searching for my voice.
* i love the idea of sci fi for a techno optimist future
relevant quotes:
* . I’d argue that science fiction—which originated concepts from the [metaverse](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/08/1044732/metaverse-history-snow-crash/) to humanoid robots—is the form of critical technology writing with the greatest impact on tech development to date. First, it’s the form that technologists actually seem to read. The allure is in the entertainment, but also in the premise that technological innovation can transform the world. Yet good sci-fi doesn’t reproduce mere techno-determinism. Instead, it acts as a [paracosm](https://joinreboot.org/p/paracosm) through which we can unravel the connections between new technologies and our values, relationships, and politics. Most essentially, sci-fi reinforces the idea that the future can always be different from the past.
* the exciting thing about this round in particular is that we're going a little broader with the roles than last time. for **editors**, that can look like excitement about any medium (e.g. podcast, video, events) vs. exclusively longform writing, and we're also bringing on a first-ever **creative director** and **marketing director** to handle all things design & distribution
	* events
	* videos

brainstorming on my unique pov:
* critical thinker on linguistics, ethics, identity
	* metaphors in the wave of ai 
	* there's a missing dialogue between linguistics and ai 
	* poetry and ai 
	* the metaphors we use to speak about ai 
* event planner, im an extrovert, i love diverse opinions 
	* quirky things -- i make networks of my life, i make maps of my diagrams, i like data visualizations within my scope 
* data science background -- data visualization and how do you influence people 
* predisposition for photography and poetry and creatives
* ai in the creative tool loop
	* tools for thought 
	* linguistics
* urbanism -- how can tech work for the city? how can we design equitable city outcomes? 
	* smart city systems
	* Yelp & Gentrification and Tik Tok Hype
	* 
* repurposing social tech in quirky contexts to work for our self expression
* - What role does literature play in helping readers to understand the conditions shaping AI’s rise and to seek alternative possibilities to what might be assumed or elided now?
	* id love to see more direct dialogue w books
	* direct dialogue w each other 
* ai x (identity) 
	* ai x gender
	* ai 
* It's very sexy in startup-world right now to talk about "tools for thought" and the "creator economy" and all that jazz. But what the thought leaders don't get is that most people are tired of abstraction, tired of scale, tired of impersonal polls and models and hockey-stick charts.[4](https://jasmine.substack.com/p/words#footnote-4-32599465) (I am thankful for the COVID scientists, but I choose to look away.) Yesterday, I asked my friends what keeps them optimistic nowadays, and got the answers _longer days, my family, not reading the news._
* https://tech-speculative.github.io/
* memory language on the internet

my background:
* doing a lot of pushes democratizing science and technology
	* communications, info sci, anthropology 
* a mix of data and visualizations 
	* interest in linguistics 
* i sped run college and i miss certain aspects of it 
	* canvas discussion forums 
	* at teh same time i yearned for an intellectual exchange of ideas i didnt quite get bc ppl hated the classes we were in

So why am I here? I want to build tools for expression and connection: for personality, community, and feeling less alone in this uncertain world. I have to be honest with you all. _I do not have a dream job; I do not dream of labor._ But I do dream of words, and perhaps here I'll find a bit of both.

**What are 2 specific themes/beats you’re excited to cover for Reboot?**

1. **Science Fiction as a Lens for Understanding Technology**
    
    - **Theme:** Exploring how science fiction narratives offer unique insights into our evolving relationship with technology.
    - **Expertise:** My background in technology and data science, combined with a deep interest in speculative fiction, equips me to analyze and interpret how sci-fi reflects and influences technological trends. I believe that science fiction is not just a genre but a critical tool for envisioning and critiquing potential futures. For instance, sci-fi has historically shaped concepts like the metaverse and humanoid robots, revealing how these ideas resonate with our values and societal structures. I am particularly interested in how sci-fi can serve as a "paracosm," a space where we can explore and critique the implications of new technologies on our lives and relationships. This thematic focus will allow me to leverage my passion for both technology and creative writing to contribute novel perspectives to Reboot.
2. **Metaphors in Language Models and AI Creativity**
    
    - **Theme:** Investigating how metaphors shape our understanding of artificial intelligence and its creative capabilities.
    - **Expertise:** With a strong background in linguistics and an enthusiasm for exploring the intersection of language and technology, I am keen to examine how metaphors influence our perception of AI’s potential, particularly in creative domains like poetry. My work in data visualization and communication strategies complements this interest, enabling me to dissect and present how metaphorical language can both reflect and shape the development of AI technologies. This exploration could include examining whether AI can produce meaningful poetry and how these creative outputs challenge or reinforce our ideas about machine intelligence.

**What are 2 headlines for pieces or events you could see yourself producing?**

1. **"The Future in Fiction: How Sci-Fi Shapes Tomorrow’s Technologies"**
    
    - **Why Interesting:** This piece would delve into how science fiction not only predicts technological advancements but also actively influences their development. By examining iconic sci-fi works and their real-world counterparts, I aim to highlight the reciprocal relationship between speculative fiction and technological innovation. This topic is intriguing because it bridges the gap between imaginative storytelling and tangible technological progress, offering readers a fresh perspective on how we envision and shape the future.
2. **"Metaphor and Machine: Can AI Craft Poetry that Resonates?"**
    
    - **Why Interesting:** This essay would investigate the role of metaphors in AI-generated poetry and explore whether such creative outputs can genuinely evoke emotional or intellectual responses. By gathering insights from linguists, technologists, and poets, I would aim to produce a comprehensive analysis of the current state of AI creativity. This topic is compelling because it challenges traditional boundaries between human and machine creativity, inviting readers to consider new possibilities for both art and technology.

**What are 2 samples of your past writing/creative work?**

1. **[Identity Formation in the Age of Digital Consumption](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wJ4QM-RNswfaqxZTLb0cQmNRtKzEWofa26uvwycFmeY/edit)**
    
    - **Description:** This article explores how digital media influences identity formation in contemporary society, showcasing my ability to analyze complex issues through a critical lens. It reflects my interest in the intersections of technology, identity, and society, aligning with Reboot’s focus on innovative perspectives.
2. **"Lost in Translation: AI, Metaphor, and the Limits of Language"**
    
    - **Description:** This piece examines how metaphors are employed in AI communication and the implications for understanding machine intelligence. It incorporates my insights from linguistics and AI to address the challenges and possibilities of metaphorical language in technology.

I am also in the process of drafting a short story exploring the ethical and existential dilemmas faced by a chatbot creator developing systems for communicating with the deceased. This narrative aims to blend speculative fiction with contemporary concerns about AI and human connection.
