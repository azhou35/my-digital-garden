title: "10-20 sadness"
---

i think i know why im sad
im a little insecure about my appearance
i like dont think im that pretty tbh 
i wish i were more photogenic
i wish i had fall pics of myself??
i think as a photographer / artist i deeply understand what makes someone attractive
and i see my own face fail in every way
and i kinda see my own face without rose colored goggles
i think some girls are able to transmute their ambition into beauty and i just dont think i have the face for it
eg tryin hard for makeup, clothes, pics, etc
i justt know im not pretty 
i have such a weird relationship to my self image
i rlly want to live authentially but also have a strong appreciation for beauty
i think i am ugly
i think i am sad i dont have any fall pics 
- it's a negative loop where im always the one w the camera -> feel awk asking for pics -> dont love the pics of me -> feel sad i dont have any pics of myself -> further hole up 
nitin is not necessarily a cause of this but some things of him have been a catayst
* i think the interaction w him and the girl that i just know is objectively attractiven
my problem is i view beauty/appearance as something that is highly controllably but also dependent on your own genetics
* it is a fact that when eric emotionally cheated on me w isa, i just knew she was objectively prettier than i 
physical beauty is definitely something i have pushed down for later
* i almost feel like i am extra nice to compensate for feeling ugly 
* i think i wish i was prettier 
it reminded me of how vinny roasted my hinge profile and said i just didnt look very pretty
i dont know what the problem is w me and photos and why i look awkward and not pretty and why it never looks like im wearing makeup 
the rational thought in me is that i def meet some sort of threshold for a cute attractive girl 
very real takeaways:
1. i do not believe i am prettier than the average girl, and i am sad that i feel behind when it comes to beauty / fashion / etc 
2. i have a strong sense of what is aesthetic photo-wise, and i am forlorn i love taking pretty pics but i rarely have pretty pics of myself. its like a self compounding loop where i am already the designated photographer ( ie i take a lot of photos at parties and hangs but no one takes pics of me ) and i am too self-conscious to proactively ask to take photos 

irrational thoughts:
1. i realize that while i am not jealous compared to the average girl, it's because seeing my partner interact w pretty girls results in a sad reaction rather than a mad one. i feel like not being pretty enough is my fault and i dont deserve love because i am less pretty. i almost feel like i dont have the right to be mad cuz im not pretty enough
2. i think i get a little triggered / sad when nitin talks about ppl being hot. maybe its bc i dont proactively say any guy is hot and i just am sad i am not like them even though its unrealistic
	1. generally hanging out w more guys and having them talk about hot girls (justin / mahesh) is making me realize prob no one would say that about me 
3. there are girls that people make art about, people write stories for, people trip over their feet for. i am not one of those girls. hence i must make art for others 
4. generally a sadness i make art out of others but no one would of me

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
again i remain sad i dont have a group of ppl my age that i feel super close w.
* going out w the girls in ow and hearing them talk about their outfits and complimenting each other and livin out of boxes together made me really want a group of girlies to do these things with. theres like an infectious brainless happy energy having a girls friend group does to u.
	* i was excited to room w shirin for this potential 
* a little sad kitty jess and vinny all hung for her bday without me adn allison
