- Framework
    
    Diagnosing the problem
    
    First, clarify the product, ecosystem, and context for the metric change. Did the change happen gradually or pretty sharply?
    
    1. **Internal Factors & Analysis**
        - Instrumentation / Product Analytics Error or Changes
            - Analytics bugs, changes in feature code, bug reports, app reviews.
        - Feature & product changes
            - Cannibalization from other features
            - Changes to design: logo, app design, user flows.
        - Experimentation & A/B Testing
        - Downtime / Maintainence. App updates, backend / algo changes. Connectivity issues.
        - Activation / Acquisition:
            - Change or drop in marketing and outreaching.
            - Changes to install/uninstall rate.
            - Change of user acquisition sources.
            - Drop-offs in user flow stages (e.g. open → user flow → close product).
        - Retention
        - Monetization
    2. **External Factors & Analysis**
        - Customer → Segment into specific category / demographic / use case / geography
        - Market & Societal Trends. Changes in demographics. Public sentiment.
        - Competitor Moves (New products/features, marketing campaigns, etc.)
        - Regulatory Environment
        - World Events. Seasonality & Holidays
        - Platform Issues
            - e.g. if product is an iPhone app, and there are issues with the iOS App Store
            - e.g. if product is a Chrome extension, and there are changes to Google Chrome itself

Clarify the goal of the product or feature, before working to improve it.

Measuring Success

- Set goal and attach North Star metric to it
- Adding a secondary, _safety rails_ metric, that will measure the fall out for optimizing for the North Star metric
    - If you're too successful in one area that may come at the expense of there parts of the business
- Other metrics:
    - Engagement → time-spent, referrals, shares,
    - Financials → transactions, revenue, profit
    - Productivity → high-value actions and outcomes
    - Acquisition → (x per week) & Retention (churn)
- A/B Testing: Focus group. Control vs sample.

Prioritization & Trade-offs

- Evaluate using factors such as:
    
    - The specific goal of the product (ask for it, or define it yourself based on best guess)
    - Ability to test hypothesis (always want to test hypothesis first)
    - Feasibility/developer time
- Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN6D4i82X_E&t=18s) again and internalize the different categories of questions to ask about the problem
    
    1. Asks a ton of questions to diagnose
    2. How to solve the problem that you found
        - First outline the goals of the company, product, or feature
        - Consider A/B tests to run
