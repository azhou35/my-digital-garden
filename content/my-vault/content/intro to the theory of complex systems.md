## **Social Processes/Cities**
- social systems are time-varying multilayer networks where individuals are nodes
- highly plastic
- individuals have states that dynamically influence nodes
- **co-evolution:** the states of individuals and their interaction network concurrently evolve and mutually influence each other 

*Cities* are a manifestation of complex systems
- path dependent + store memory, where history signifcantly influences future evolution 
- **meso-level phenomena** where its between individual & system wide scales. eg neighborhood dynamics or traffic jams, where individual actions -> patterns that are not visible
- see: [[content/social network theory|social network theory]]

takeaways:- how to reframe social problems not as optimization challenges but emergent coordination challenges?
	_How do desirable macro behaviors emerge from messy micro-decisions?_
	nudge **spatial behaviors through affordance changes**
urban design:
- - _What behaviors are currently over-afforded?_ (e.g., car traffic dominance)
    
- _What latent behaviors are under-supported?_ (e.g., public sitting, informal markets, chance interaction)
    
- _How can I **reallocate spatial resources** to signal new possibilities?_ (e.g., trees, furniture, lines of sight, lighting)
- 

## Evolution <> Innovation
- how to apply evolutionary models for economic predictions


**complex systems theory:**
- systems are adaptive, resilient,and self-healing, but capable of sudden, nonlinear collapse when pushed past certain thresholds
- phase transitions & tipping points in complex systems
- systems appear stable until they hit critical threshold where small disturbance leads to massive sdtructural change
