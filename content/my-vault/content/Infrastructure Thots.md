Infrastructure is the backbone that makes up our society, from social and political structures, to the technological structures that power our internet and networking.

It's one of those things you don't realize is there until it goes awry - CrowdStrike goes down from a faulty Azure error and airplanes across the US shut down. 

As WIP writer once said - *Neglect Kills.* Maintenance isn't sexy. But it's essential to keeping everything afloat. 

It's why the cloud hyperscalers focus so much on *reliability.* Reliability means clunky, reliability means dependencies, reliability often sacrifices fast-paced iterations and shiny design. 

Its the hidden skeleton underpinning systems. And thus when something goes wrong at point A, it quickly propagates at a cascading rate. 

My day job has primed me the ins and outs out HPC infrastructure, specifically for AI/ML workloads. 

I'm also intrigued by urban infrastructure, such as transportation systems.

Questions arise: how does congestion pricing affect supply chain management across the city?
