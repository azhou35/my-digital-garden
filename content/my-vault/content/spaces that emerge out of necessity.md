rather than pure design

* tin building on a sunny day - pier 17
	* grey slab blocks in the middle of the pier, with the huge purple bridge and imposing city buildings in your front view 
	* the construction of a block: perfect for sitting and laying down like a seal
		* at the first crack of sixty degrees people are lying down and sunbathing, using their jackets to shield their eyes 
		* kids running around 
		* sunglasses on 
* rough draft books
* flushing food courts 
* right outside of brookfield place during lunch time

people invent chairs out of blocks
a chair is used to steal a bite, let your kid jump up and down
