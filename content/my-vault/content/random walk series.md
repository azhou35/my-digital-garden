title: "random walk series"

inspired by [[Fractal Journaling]]
>"Fractal journaling and randomization are how I tend my garden"


starting a series when i take a concept or theory and apply it to the different topics on my mind - likely ai/technology, cultural observations, and the human bids for connection. 
(maybe every other week, i'll choose a random note from obsidian)

**random walk 01: friction**

picture your brain as a labyrinth: choose at arbitrary topic X, allow your  mind to wander, and lead you to Y and Z and otherwise.  thoughts permeate outward into different domains, not unlike ink spreading through water.

the most interesting insights often live at the intersections. when we examine how a single pattern manifests across different contexts.
this is how i imagine my writing process - it emerges naturally from these random walks. i want to document these mental exercises and elucidate the serendipity that i derive in my connections and encourage others to follow their curiosities to their very ends. 

this leads me to a new experiment, a biweekly series i'll entitle *random walks.* inspired by the way thoughts naturally ripple in our minds, i want to take a concept and passing through all the different dimensions i can observe it under. tangibly, this means taking some abstract metaphor and applying it to the topics of interest to me - likely ai/technology, cultural observations, and overthinking human connection. a little less introspection, a dash more analysis. 

this could come from the collections i have in my obsidian, arena. while my usual writing weaves together multidisciplinary connections, i want to use this space as a forcing function to comment on ideas as they come, documenting thoughts in a furiously fast innovation cycle. let's connect the dots looking backwards.

i want to provide insight to the articles and content online that reminds me of this word as well. 

ideas: 
* [[friction as a forcing function]] across ai chat bots, conversations in real life, and also within user interfaces
* **shared air** within coffee shops, silent discos, coworking spaces, and on the internet [[notes on ambient co-presence]]
* hand-writing within her, within empathetic ai, within notecards, memory making through hand-written letters [[her in 2025]]
* **thresholds** within technology adoption, relationships, 
* **resonance** in art, human connection, and meaning making 
* **recursion** in code, etc
* **amortization** 
* **taste** [[taste]]
