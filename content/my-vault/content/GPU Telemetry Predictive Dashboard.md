title: "GPU Telemetry Predictive Dashboard"

 **Problem**: Enterprises overprovision hardware (GPUs, robots, turbines) to hedge against downtime and inefficiency, leading to: Bloated CapEx (e.g., buying 20% extra GPUs "just in case"). Wasted OpEx (e.g., idle factory robots, overcooled data centers). Stranded assets (e.g., wind turbines running at 60% capacity). How can we be proactive about GPU downtime?
 
**What**: Open source tool/SaaS platform that models infrastructure as dynamic graphs (GNNs) to predict failures, optimize resources, and simulate “what-if” scenarios. Uses hyperdimensional embeddings (HDC) for real-time anomaly detection with 10x less compute than LLMs. Uses edge compute agents to gather data on the client side and train internal ML models. 

Customers:
* Site reliability engineers to manage and triage solutions
* Engineers who deploy ML models using GPUs
* Upper leadership to monitor metrics 

**MVP Architecture Data Ingestion**: Use open-source tools like Telegraf or Prometheus to collect server/GPU metrics. For factories, integrate with PLCs (programmable logic controllers) via Node-RED. Anomaly Detection: Start with Isolation Forest or Autoencoders (simple, explainable). Use Azure ML or Google Vertex AI for managed training. Dashboard: Build with Grafana or Streamlit for visualization. Add basic root-cause analysis (e.g., “CPU spike → check cooling”).
