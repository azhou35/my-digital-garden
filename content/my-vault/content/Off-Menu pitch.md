title: "Off-Menu pitch"
---


It would be ideal to narrow down on your subject. I like this idea of "challenge[ing] traditional wine culture hierarchies," and I suggest you focus on one place/wine bar to illustrate this overarching idea of disrupting classical wine culture. Perhaps you could explore the inspiration of the creatives behind the wine bar (e.g. flavor focused) or dive into an origination story behind this phenomenon of natural wine culture meeting Asian cultural roots in the city. Either way, this is all yours— I'm just here to guide!
Asian regions are not particularly well-renown for being wine regions - yet there's a surge in cultural-themed wine bars in the city. Natural wine’s boom meets Asian cultural roots—e.g., how fish-sauce caramel pairs with skin-contact whites. I'd love to interview a host of people - Richard Jang from Sinsa, the Mam / Di and Di team behind La Rai. Questions to ask include - how do you cultivate a mysterious yet culturally accurate space within the competitive nightlife scene? I'd like to explore the delicate balance between authenticity and accessibility in design and atmosphere. This piece would also examine how these spaces challenge traditional wine culture hierarchies.

Lai Rai:
I'd like to narrow down on Lai Rai and use their unique wine bar as a centerpiece of my question: how can Southeast Asian wine bars challenge traditional wine culture hierarchies?
* Viet-forward wine bar with a well curated list of sparkling/whites/reds
* Branding: playing reruns of famous viet actors at Golden Globes, old viet artists on instagram 
* how these spaces challenge traditional wine culture hierarchies
	* European vs Asian wine culture 
	* Asian history vs colonialism 
		* Wine history in vietnam - what does this have to do with french colonialism? banh mi with french baguette? laughing cow cheese is french? 
		* Vietnamese cuisine bears clear markers of French colonialism - how can a wine program acknowledge and respond to this history?
		* "How do you approach educating customers who might be more familiar with traditional European wine service?"
		* - "What assumptions about wine culture do you most want to challenge?"
	* the choice to feature ice cream with wine - tongue-in-cheek? intentional? egregious?
* Viet rice wine 
	* Similar to sake (pours me sake first)
	* It's a difficult drink - less popular but this wine bar is trying to expand its reach
	* Goes well w laughing cow cheese

* inspiration of creatives behind wine bar:
	* Mam challenging flavors in the city 
  
Opening Scene (The Hook):
- Start in media res: A vivid Friday night at Lai Rai
- The sensory contradictions that immediately signal this isn't a typical wine bar:
    - Vintage Vietnamese film footage flickering overhead
    - A sommelier pouring rice wine alongside natural wine
    - Laughing Cow cheese being served with deliberate ceremony
- This scene sets up our central tension: tradition vs. disruption

The Colonial Context (Historical Foundation):

- Transition through the Laughing Cow cheese as our entry point into history
- Brief but pointed exploration of wine's colonial legacy in Vietnam
- How French influence shaped Vietnamese dining culture
- Critical insight: This history isn't being rejected, but rather reclaimed and transformed

The Intentional Disruption (Core Analysis):

- How Lai Rai's team deliberately plays with these historical elements
- Their philosophy behind "egregious" pairings
- The elevation of rice wine as equal to natural wine
- The careful balance of accessibility and provocation in their approach

The New Culture Being Created (Broader Significance):

- How these choices reflect a larger movement in Asian-American dining
- The creation of spaces that don't defer to European traditions
- What this means for the future of wine culture in New York

Circle Back (Resolution):

- Return to a scene at Lai Rai that shows these themes in action
- Perhaps a specific moment of customers experiencing this cultural transformation
	- two white patrons saying - fish sauce ice cream?? laughing cow cheese?
- End on a forward-looking note about what this represents for wine culture
Would love to hear a narrowed down pitch when you're ready!
