4pm, phantom wildfire smoke sets haunting glow on manhattan skyline, M and I stare at the immobile ducks lying on still water with the upside down city reflection. 
i tell him how photography helps with solo walks. i enjoy traveling with people because u are observing the world together and getting real-time feedback on what you're seeing. if i see a cool tree or church i can point it out. if i were just walking alone and see a pretty scene with no one around me, i feel sullen. but with the camera, it's a phantom friend that i can talk to, take a picture, and preserve that moment for a future conversation, when i show a friend *look at this that i just saw!*
cameras are a great friend for moments of introversion at a party. there are moments when your convo goes dead and you hear the uproar around you pressing into your eardrums. camera as escape, i can melt away into the background and float around and take photos.
M asks: how do you not get self-conscious pointing your camera at people?

7PM, Sam Sunny, 8 kids from my consulting club (SOCIAL IMPACT THEMED important distinction)
context: all these kids are pretty wholesome and like kinda anti-work but not woke enough to actually do anything about it lmao. i feel like everyones kinda silly and kind. i never truly related to them bc we are on different intellectual wave lengths but its good to scatch that itch for community with them.

alethia -- the upperclassman im closest to, we didnt get to catch up over dinner but on the train ride home we had a rlly energetic convo where she told me about how she also wants to write narrative short-form and how someone even older her in the club (ucy) asked HER if she knew about me and my writing (aka some rando cornell alum found my writing and made it seem i was like known in that circle LMAO). i told her about writing club !! said sometime me and her and lucy can join 

generally ppl commented i seemed very active in nyc and thought it was cute i was making community (they saw the bookbear picnic and thought it was a book club LOLLL)
these group setting hangs are good, enough ppl im decently familiar with to catch up. but again most its hard to catch up 1:1 cuz we're always dancing around surface level topics except for alethia haah
