[[social network theory]]
- i am the epicenter of this gathering
- actually liked what ppl said about me when we went around the circle
	- justin said my kindness
	- cat said my intentionality
	- vinny said im the most interesting friend he has and all my hobbies and good at bringing ppl together
- big fan of seeing what is most saliently rememberable by the ppl around me 
- and how diff ppl from diff contexts will say diff things
	- a reflectin of their values and maybe a window into why we maintain this friendship
