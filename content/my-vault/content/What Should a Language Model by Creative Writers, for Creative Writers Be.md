title: "What Should a Language Model by Creative Writers, for Creative Writers Be"
---

A workshop hosted in Feb 2025 
_What would make a "good" language model for writers?_ How would you, as a creative writer, artist, teacher, or scholar, ideally engage with language models? What would constitute a “good enough” model that would open up new activities currently unsupported by existing models? The goal of this workshop is understand the attributes of a language model (e.g. ethical data collection or creative capabilities) that would make such a model attractive.
