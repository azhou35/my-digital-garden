title: "im not actually lonely tbh"
---

i think this solitude is actually really good because it helps me focus on my own work instead of yapping all the time 
i would like a person to just wake up and say hi to -- but i think this is normal 
i really enjoy the lowstatus

* first time without friday plans in a while, ig i do feel a little lonely. 
* went from summer club to nothing but all the hobbies i wanna get done
* did paint my nails -- success!
* a little bit annoyed that none of my cornell friends r hitting me up... 
* but i think i need to take this as a sign to lock in 
* this is my night to just write and reflect on myself and achieve a flow state again
* you dont need to settle for any person who would take you as a roomie -- you have standards
* i think im just an extroverted who gets too excited by messages and social activity -- maybe i need to mute my phone ?
