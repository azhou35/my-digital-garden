[[thawing - instructions on not giving up - there will come soft rains]]

theme: strength through vulnerability rather than despite it

hey stranger,

raindrops tap against my window, steady and gentle. they sound like a lullaby; they feel like a home. early march bears witness to a city emerging from hibernation, drawn to the call of false spring; the encore of daylight savings is followed by a whisper of dreary days. 

there's beauty in how we thaw from invincible winter -- a return to self, soft light washing over the bottomless darkness. morning sun peeks in and gasps for air, gasps until it demands attention and reveals its ochre completely, painting delicate shadows against my wall.

this season is the season i mistake pollen allergies for tears, tears for rain. *i am deliriousness with my tenderness,* i write in my journal to no one in particular. i've been crying more often recently - side comments for coworkers and general ennui pulling down my facial features like a string and leaking myself dry. 

growing up, my mom always warned me i was too sensitive. i'd come home to her in tears about some comments a classmate made. no longer her girl, i've become a tree naked in the wind: knees, rattling like branches, hands, shaking like the last leaf. too often than not, the situation is that i've worn my heart of my sleeve, offered a friend my deepest thoughts and prickled at their uncaring responses. indifference in the face of vulnerability. 

at the sight of my stream-streaked expression she'd envelop me in her warmth like a second skin. *you need to learn to be strong*. like soft moss, the reminder melts into me. young annie was a crybaby, and in a way i still contain her inside of me.  

isn't it true: even the grass weeps in the sight of morning? that to see green flourish there first must come soft rains?

sensitive. i hate the word. used as a bullet against me, my manager telling me *you're a little sensitive* and making the tears well up a little harder. i have no poker face - my emotions are clear as day. answering* the question of why i'm crying is always the hardest. there is no rhyme or reason. 

how can i help it, when i learned sensibility from my mother? to be strong is not to be hard - it's to hold softness as a virtue. i learned how to hold a deep sense of care for a world that is otherwise indifferent. it's a strength to anticipate the needs of others before they voice it. but it leaves you vulnerable to be so highly open. where i wince at the punch before i see the fist. at the sight of a clenched fist all i want to do is open it. 

maybe that's why poetry is so provoking to me - i believe to read into poetry you must be highly attuned to your senses - whether that manifests through *sensitivity* or *sensibility* is up to you. 

ray bradbury once said: 
"There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn 
Would scarcely know that we were gone"

spring rain falls and the leaves unfurl gently, fists opening into palms. they don't fight against their own nature, but they rather accept and respond.

dear stranger, i have a question - is it strength to cocoon yourself within layers of bark, such that you only reveal yourself in moments of harvest? or is strength to leave yourself vulnerable to the elements that seize you? 

i always pass by an elementary school on my morning runs. during a rainy morning, the kids scramble out in their raincoats, jump for joy in the puddles, uncaring of tear-streaked rainboots. my fingertips tingle with the sensation of yearning - to reach out and touch the rain. i dont want to just watch rain on glass - i want to feel it on my skin. 

near the school, there's this one part of the street that's offset higher. on one run, i fall like summer thunder, spectacular and dramatic. a crack against asphalt, my kneecap breaks open, and impact punches its way into my gut. 

months later, a second skin has grown over as a scab. on another run earlier this week, i fall again. a phantom follow-up punch to my gut.

each fall is just as painful. each fall elicits a sharp cry and a red-hot pain that leaves me convulsing on the pavement. strength does not come from avoiding the first cry; strength comes from the will to pick yourself back up and keep running. strength comes from endurance.

if body be a blade it cuts itself from day to day. blade of grass, soft and unwavering in its height. strength comes from grace, grace comes from breaking apart and putting yourself back together. 

 instructions on not giving up // reasons to stay 
 - fluffy moss gathering on the rocks
 - because you can dance in the rain, dance even when the music is over, even when there's no music around.
 - morning fog EEWAR
 
 

my mother is the first person to teach me that to be strong, you must be attuned to your senses. that to be strong, you must feel your emotions completely but steel yourself, that you cannot give up. that there are circumstances outside of your control and the only thing you shape is the garden within you. 




《春雨》是唐代诗人杜甫所作的一首诗，以下是全诗： ***春雨*** 好雨知时节， 当春乃发生。 随风潜入夜， 润物细无声。 野径云俱黑， 江船火独明。 晓看红湿处， 花重锦官城。

*spring is here, almost* -- even when the grass still 
a younger annie dances in the rain. dances, even when the music is over, seen insane by those who could not hear the music. 
ri miss dancing in the rain. 
 even the lowers
i want to be bright beautiful and true

bright growing things 


i want to feel emotions, deeply and surely.
