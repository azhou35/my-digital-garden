title: "map of my relationship with nitin"
---


I want to create a visual "scrollytelling" data story that can be deployed as a website to tell the story of important landmarks to me & my boyfiends relationship. I want to have an interactive image of the NYC map in the background, with different restaurants/park benches/points of interest that map to important moments in our relationship. 
I want to use data visualization techniques, ideally JS. Might need a GIS file for the map. 
And then I want to manually code locations & descriptions and superimpose it onto the map.
