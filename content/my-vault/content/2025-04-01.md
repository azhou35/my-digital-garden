things to buy
* aluminum foil
* dish washer
* pods

i feel quite listless in the office right now 
i understand that i need to probably do work + document things 
i have nothing to do but snack and drink 
producing no outputs 

reflections on power bi work:
* i do have a sense of ownership and responsibility over things at my job - i just need to make sure that doesnt make slip into complacency 

cx7 validation is going on right now to validate that it work everything else
once that finishes
eta for that mid april
pending any results that come up
if there's failure/regression we would have to re-evaluate
however, if it's good the earliest we can roll out changes 
3rd/4th week of april
looking for feedback on which clusters to go first
this is our proposal 
sat13
phx61 last bc of nfz
is there a particular cluster u want us to update first
trying to avoid updating all at once since its quite a couple of coordination 
exact timing and scheduling to come later 

sometihng to think about is which order to apply them
