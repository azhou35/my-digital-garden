My two minute pitch:
I've always been fascinated by how the tools we create end up shaping our reality. Growing up, I loved literature and poetry for how they help us understand human experience, but I was equally drawn to engineering because I wanted to help build the systems that influence how we live. That's why I went to engineering high school and did data science at Cornell. There I got my first foray into startups with Cornell Venture Capital and even my project team, DTI, where we developed products for the college community. Like I worked on a study buddy matching platform for Cornell's DEI. Did a lot of product exploration and also developer advocacy as a technical writer.  

After graduation, I joined Microsoft as a TPM on AI Supercomputing. The timing was perfect - I stepped in during our OpenAI partnership when technical teams had been working separately for years. Beyond optimizing GPU infrastructure, I found myself naturally bridging technical complexity with human needs - basically humanizing these complex systems.

What I've realized this past year is that while I love understanding what computing looks like at scale, I'm really drawn to earlier stages where I can have more direct impact. I'm especially interested in areas like digital biology, healthcare, AI infrastructure, and data visualization - fields where there's both technical depth and this need to make complex things accessible to everyone. Generally interested in niche market opportunities 

I care deeply about creating technology that meets people where they are - whether they're engineers or English teachers. There's something powerful about translating technical capabilities into tools that feel intuitive and empowering.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on navigating the startup ecosystem as someone early in their career. 

I'm curious about which startups in your portfolio might value someone with my background in infrastructure who also brings this passion for making technology more accessible.

Questions:
* "How do you stay connected with the Cornell entrepreneurship community? Are there any Cornell-specific networks or events I should be plugging into?"
* What was your own path from Cornell into venture capital? Were there any unexpected turns that led you where you are today?
* Cornell is rather pre-professional - how did you reckon the jump to starting your own thing at Dashfund? 
	* How do you reccomend going against the grain?
* "Have you worked with other Cornell grads who've made the transition from big tech to startups? What was their experience like?"
* How do your portfolio founders typically think about building their early teams? What roles are they prioritizing right now?
* What do you think is the biggest misconception people from big tech have when transitioning to startups
* What's one skill you think would be worth developing further that would make me more valuable to early-stage companies?
* How do you create opportunities and build relationships?
