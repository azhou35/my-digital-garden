in a book on cinematography, it comments that good directors treat the setting as another character. in this personal movie, treat the city as another beast. hear the low rumble underneath your feet that threatens to swallow you whole. culture feels visceral in nyc. aesthetic sensibilities pop out on the street even the way passerby carry themselves is distinct 
but crowds can feel constricting, especially when you are untethered from a companion or a purpose. i mytholize it; the open jaws of a subway swallowing commuters whole, 
tattoeed with words, pockets of vulnerability on your morning commute.
