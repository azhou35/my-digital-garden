What do I want to do with my writing / substack?
I enjoy writing as a way to tell a story and engage with friends & mutuals
**Substackers who I enjoy:**
* Lyndsey Kong
* Justin Kartelero 

**Substackers who I dislike:**
* anyone who is just a glorified list of recommendations 

**Facts** / thoughts
* Right now I write at a monthly basis
* I dont' have much of a system for writing nor a commitment to a schedule
* I am very honest about who I am (have my real name and such). 
	* maybe i should be more mysterious? use fake names? remove my last name? 
* Should I write shorter articles? similar to "jasmine"? more like prose-like vignettes that capture a vibe 
* What helps my substack stand out:
	* references to poetry / generally poetic writing 
	* analytical interests due to stem background
	* my street photos
* What could be my niche?
	* street photography -- notes on nyc, photography, sociology, urbanism, etc 

**Topics I could Write about**
* Coworking / copresence / cafes 
	* Reflections on a remote worker
	* Porter concert / writing club 
	* solitude / loneliness 
* Keeping a high permeability to wonder 
	* NYC is a perfect place 
	* astronomy and why that is interesting 
* Running as a discipline / habit 
* Write while walking / the art of walking
* Coziness and cooking with friends
	* "hygge" in copenhagen in time for daylight savings 
	* there is an article i meant to write during my time abroad that i never got around to -- theres a special joy in cooking with friends 
	* cooking in small kitchens is funny 
* Creativity vs content
	* Content is easy to scale, creativity is more close to who I am
* Authenticity -- why is it important, what are the cognitive dissonances in my life
* Nameless feeling -- on pure joy, love, etc
	* wishing someone could see things thru ur pov -- this is what art is for 
	* this is what metaphors are for 
* Notes on street photography
	* why does the camera fail compared to the human eye 
	* Why is editing so important
