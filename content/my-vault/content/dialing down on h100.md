title: "dialing down on h100"
---

looking at other skus
OAI
continue to use H100 for inferencing clusters
moving to h200 and GB200 
previously 
expected drop 
continue all the way thru the end of the year
should not 
- Track H200 and GB200 
- See if theres a corresponding trend 
- only tracking the VM sizes
- non IW 
- push to use IW more for inference 
- OAI is moving inference to IW training clusters 
- H200, GB200, does this include dedicated clusters
