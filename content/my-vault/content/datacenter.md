NV GB200: 
* requires direct to chip liquid cooling
* has up to 130kW rack power density delivering ~9x inference and ~3x training performance improvements over the H100
* Blackwell has standardized the requirements and now suppliers and system designers have a clear roadmap for AI datacenter development
