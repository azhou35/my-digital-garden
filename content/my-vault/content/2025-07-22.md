**One API to Rule Them All:**

As a TPM at Microsoft's AI Infrastructure team, I've built operational frameworks that improved GPU infrastructure reliability for AI customers like OpenAI, developed metrics informing hardware allocation, and optimized utilization across our AI supercomputing stack. Beyond the infrastructure side, I've led 0->1 initiatives in our growing genomics vertical, translating usage data into new product opportunities and prototyping solutions for new customer segments. 

Working within Microsoft's AI infrastructure team, I witnessed a fundamental disconnect: brilliant researchers spending more time wrestling with infrastructure than scientific progress. This pattern convinced me that AI's next inflection point isn't about better models, but about making production-grade deployment easier. Inference is the bottleneck. 

A lot of what you’re building resonates with me deeply—especially the clarity of the platform vision (simplifying LLM access across providers) and the focus on execution velocity.


I’m now looking to move closer to the product edge—working on tools that unlock new model-native use cases, support real developer needs, and operate under real latency + cost constraints. The chance to be the first dedicated PM, shape the roadmap, and partner tightly with engineering at OpenRouter really excites me.

From developing copilots for customers that automate workflows to orchestrating supercomputers for OpenAI, I've seen first-hand the complexity of building and maintaining GPU infrastructure. Fireworks is attacking this complexity head-on.

- **How does OpenRouter think about the tradeoff between being a neutral aggregator vs. optimizing for specific models or providers?**
    
- **What are the most critical use cases you're seeing today — chatbots, RAG, agents, creative tools, etc.?**
    
- **How do you see your role evolving as the open-source model ecosystem improves and commoditizes inference?**

### 🛠️ **Execution & Challenges**

- **What’s the biggest product bottleneck or challenge today? Is it prioritization, roadmap clarity, customer insight loops, etc.?**
    
- **How does the team currently run planning and prioritization? How do you balance infra reliability vs. user-facing features?**
    
- **What’s something non-obvious or messy about the routing layer that most people outside the company wouldn’t understand?**
- **What’s the next layer OpenRouter wants to build on top of inference — is it developer tooling, agents, orchestration, observability?**
    
- **Do you see OpenRouter becoming more opinionated or staying fully neutral in the future?**
