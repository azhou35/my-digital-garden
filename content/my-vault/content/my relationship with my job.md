The concerns I shared with Cat:
* right now we both feel existentially stuck 
* maybe exercise: what do I actually want out of my career? 
* i dont think we can focus on the long term game -- just the next steps
my plan:
* WRITE and maybe build substack / writing community on the side 
	* 500 subscribers ??
* be like sherry / ava bookbear ? communities on newsletter?
* career wise
	* upskill in design
		* apply to roles such as . It’s part PM and part design. You’ll be listening to customers and helping us brainstorm the best experience to solve their development problems
			* try this application -- create a website 
		* research dev tools / creative AI / run your own experiments & designs & interfaces
			* maybe work on a goodreads redesign?
		* lot of startup energy re: creative tool & interfaces
	* hack on creative UI ideas 
	* develop skill in linguistics / llms 
		* learn more into prompt engineering 
	* upskill in my job domain
		* hack on copilot / llm stuff 
* apply to accelerators
	* [Apply to Female Founder Circles! (typeform.com)](https://wrofv7e513i.typeform.com/to/feZfH8aD?typeform-source=www.pear.vc)
