conclusion to roomie situation

priorities:
- prep for lai rai 
- finish up dash board
- send out substack
- apply to httpoetics
- do ramp

research dump:
- _scaling inference-time compute for fuzzy tasks_. we know how to scale inference-time compute to get reliable improvements on tasks with well-defined answers (this is how ai [beat humans](https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-confirms-new-frontier-models-o3-and-o3-mini/) on contest math / programming in 2024) but have no way of doing this for tasks with poorly-defined rewards; my go-to examples of such tasks are fashion and telling jokes. models have still managed to get better at these tasks over time, but only via better pretraining and posttraining, which is a problem because if you can’t scale capabilities at inference time then you’re essentially bottlenecked by the capability of the original model
    
    - the [r1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) paper was a helpful update for me in that it convinced me there were no surprises behind current reasoning models. i applied to openai in november but by the time my final interview rolled around in february i’d become quite confident there were no major research secrets to learn there, so i canceled my interview <3
        
- _model understanding_. this includes traditional interpretability but also better benchmarks and reporting, better ways of eliciting behaviors from models, user and deception modeling, bias and discrimination, some forms of privacy, etc. i really do think [transluce](https://transluce.org/) is the best place in the world to work on this class of problems and am happy to be there
    
    - i don’t have much to say on this subject beyond the projects we’re already working on, which you can see on our website
        
- _deployment._ this mostly refers to the interfaces through which humans and ai interact. our current interfaces are almost entirely autocomplete and chat, which is fine for linear text-based tasks, but i don’t think we’ve really discovered the right interfaces for human-ai collaboration on other tasks; my go-to example here is [music](https://czhuang.github.io/) / songwriting, where chat and autocomplete are very obviously not the right paradigm
    
    - compute efficiency is also part of deployment, but i feel less of a need to work on it given that the cost of running ai systems (at a fixed level of capabilities) has been [dropping 5-10x every year](https://www.wing.vc/content/plummeting-cost-ai-intelligence). efficiency is certainly important, but among all problems in the field it’s probably the one we’ve been making the most steady progress on as the economic incentives are so strong
product studio idea:
[Late Checkout](https://www.latecheckout.studio/contact)

A product studio is a lab for generating and testing ideas, then turning them into businesses.

You can think of the studio model as a powerful de-risking machine. The main way it de-risks is through diversification. Studios improve their chances of success by taking a bunch of shots on net rather than just one.

But herein lies the paradox of modern technology: Silicon Valley has always excelled at making things people want, but “what we want” is never a fixed, easy thing. There’s what I want right now versus what I want in the long run, what I want for myself versus for society at large.

aditya meeting
where do u want to take planned maintenance next
- what do you need to unblock 
- whats stopping u from getting u 

building 
flow chart version of what are the diff teams i have to interact out with planned maintenance 
impactful impactless

aditya owns opex for everyone
take on the meeting 
connect to the dc team
mostly worked w vijit
connected to all these people and know whats going on 
connecting w amy 
ai - 
- ask for her a list on which ppl are connected to which dcs
- run the meeting as u want for now
- dc updates 
- if u think u dont need it cancel the meeting
- identify what the goals are 
- if its not serving the purpose 

too much demand
asking for a cluster to run
