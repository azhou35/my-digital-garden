my thoughts on startup stages

-1 to 0  
important to understand in what areas emerging technology creates venture scale opportunities, in which of these areas incumbents have an advantage, what is the likelihood of success in each area (some require more luck than others). constrain 0-1 and job hunting to these areas when founding or looking for opportunities. intuition here will get better with time and experience if you make decisions based on it.

0 to 1  
involves luck, iteration on ICP and product. certain skills like fundraising and carrying out viral launches maximize luck and time to iterate at this stage, but they aren’t substitutes for efficient iteration and being good at the stages that come before and after. joining a co at this stage is equivalent to founding one yourself - pretty risky but potentially worth it for the right insight/idea/mission.

initial PMF  
keeping PMF amidst competition, communicating to ICP's, sustaining a company through customer demand requires solid leadership, execution, and understanding of the market, customer base, and ideal product trajectory.

post PMF  
some companies succeed and continue to find PMF in adjacent markets or expand their initial one. other companies realize their markets aren’t venture scale, lack defensibility against incumbents at scale, etc. sometimes this is an unavoidable outcome and sometimes it could have been negated by better -1 to 0 intuition or execution after initial PMF. if you see through hype at any of the previous stages you can increase your chances of avoiding this outcome in companies you join
