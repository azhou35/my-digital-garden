[Advice for an Open-Ended Job Search](https://nwilliams030.substack.com/p/how-to-job-hunt-across-several-industries)

### Frameworks
1. Hard constraints
	1. Remote/NYC office
	2. Path to success / acquisition
2. Soft things you want
	1. 
3. Ideas/projects/work u find fun

Advice from Justin:
Pitch yourself differently based on three ppl:
1) I want to pitch you on a role (founders)
2) I want to join your team as a PM (head of X)
	1) **"I want to join your team as a Technical PM or Founding PM focused on AI/ML Infrastructure, bridging the gap between complex systems and user-centric outcomes.**  My sweet spot is translating infrastructure optimizations into tangible business metrics—reducing inference costs, accelerating iteration cycles, or unlocking new use cases in fields like drug discovery. At my current role, I’ve worked directly with engineering teams to define and meet SLAs for AI workloads, and build out technical assistants to help HPC researchers use batch processing and at a legal tech startup, I built product processes from zero. If you’re building tools to democratize LLM scalability for enterprises or rethinking the data stack for generative AI, let’s connect."  
3) I want to build a relationship / learn more (anyone)
It's about hitting the right person w the right message and if they are opportunistic to chat
Right input expectation: having the right convos and learning how to position yourself 

My pitch dump:
* Currently a technical product manager working on AI/HPC Infrastructure software, specifically driving operational excellence of the GPU performance for our supercomputing partnership with OpenAI. Experience with product and design in startups (e.g. first PM at a legal tech startup pre-LLM surge), also with investigating Azure's charter with AI drug discovery startups. Really interested in the evolving data/ml infra landscape as everyones trying to figure out how do we make these LLMs work at scale, for enterprises, and ultimately lead to material gain for the end user.
* I want to pitch you on a role:
* I want to join your team as a:
* I want to learn more about how X is doing Y to accomplish Z. 
Two types of projects:
1. PM at a LLM lab 
2. TPM of a AI application layer app
