1. IAD02PrdGPC01 (lithium a) pushed out from 1/13 - 1/14 as per Jack's request above  
2. **EAT03PrdGPC07 DFW25PrdGPC01 CYS13PrdGPC09 will continue their batches.** 
3. **SYD60PrdGPC01 GVX21PrdGPC03 GVX21PrdGPC01** are present in my list but not Day 0. 
4. OSL28PrdGPC02 GVX21PrdGPC02 is pending confirmation on shared - can we close on this? 
5. GVX21PrdGPC04 is in Day 0 - this is decom'ed, can we remove this?

Saagar's point
on applied - if something is broken we take it out and send it back to azure

on research - 
- if something is broken but not broken enough to send it over
- large point oeprations - there were nodes that were semi unhealthy
	- initial step function loss is much higher
	- semi-degraded are sent back to Azure back to OFR
- h100/h200 heat remediation 
	- we send the nodes back
- we will lose 
- IW is the worst set of clusters 
	- replaced 30% of GPUs in IW 


Paint the picture for maintenance problem
operationally easier
minimal automation
where do we to make our lives easier
how many nodes where we wanna send to OFr ahead of time
project the fallout
bouncing a healthy 
we have all the data to be proactive

Selection:

the main things to remember are:  
1. maintenance start and end dates  
2. maintenance event id (should be idempotent -- something monotonically increasing is likely fine)  
3. list of node serials (or node ids?) affected (maybe as foreign keys to the ndb nodes table which i believe has node id as the pk)  
4. probably it would be nice to have the csp as a single field for easier checking (i assume some csp will have different types of actions)  
5. noc ops we need to perform before maintenance (besides a cordon and drain. i.e. right now for sev3 with cw they want us to run the power-off-carnation action plugin.) let's assume there can be multiple here  
6. status (something like NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, PARTIALLY_COMPLETE (when the expected end date has been reached but we see some x% of nodes are still unhealthy)  
7. allowable unhealthy percentage (annie will work with providers to get a sort of sla for maintenancnes -- this would mean, for example, if we have a maintenance of 100 nodes and an sla of 95% that we expect 95 nodes to be healthy for the maintenance to be marked as complete). this might be different on a per maintenance event level which is why i suggest it as a field  
8. _end_ end date -- so let's say that at the first end date we check if the nodes are all healthy and they're not (like what has happened with the azure sev currently ongoing where they expected the nodes to be done by lets say 9am and they weren't actually done by then). this second end date will be much farther in the future and will be the date where the maintenance automatically resolves and some actions are done (i.e. just heal all healthy nodes). this might be helpful if some nodes fall through the cracks or we are busy  
8. pocs (slack usernames)  
  
i think those are the main things --
