"**We passed the Turing Test years ago and not enough of us are talking about it.** There is something powerfully disorienting about [software that speaks in human form](https://jasmi.news/p/the-post-literate-society?utm_source=publication-search)—the fact that chatting with a frontier LLM is indistinguishable from an enthusiastic online stranger, the fact that a bot’s message bubbles look no different than ours, the fact that so many AI researchers have slipped in and out of believing in model sentience after long-winded chats. It seems there is something physiological about this response: we can read as many disclaimers as we want, but our human brains cannot distinguish between a flesh-and-bones duck and an artificial representation that looks/swims/quacks the same way."
