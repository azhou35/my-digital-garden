Imagine you are me, a 23 year old ambitious girl who feels slighted they didnt get into an Ivy or get the best new grad job. They are happy with theri life in NYC with their support network and boyfriend, but they are unhappy with how boring their job is. They got an offer to be a Forward Deployed PM at Fireworks AI, a Series B -> C growing Inference platform startup. Help advise on whether they should 1) nuke their personal life and move to Redwood City for the startup, potentially straining their 1 year relationship 2) wait for more jobs and opportunities in NYC, and close the door on SF forever. 

Tom (primary VC) - 
you should stay in nyc bc if the job isnt a hell yes even if the title is good its not worth uprooting your life for bc the comp and team and product arent exactly jumping out at you. there will be more opportunities to come.

Dad 
you shoudl go to silicon valley because that is where the opportunity is and you will not find pm jobs of a similar flavor in nyc if you stay and you will stay at microsoft for a while. AI startups are not as much here and more ni the fintech realm. 

Mom
you should follow your heart. if you go to SF i will support you. if you go to NYC you can find a mid sized job.

Angela
Do you even really want to work at an early AI startup? if you are not sure you can go to a smaller mid sized company in NYC. 

Nitin
Very important opinion. Hes very hurt by this and has genuine conviction that I can find a similar / better job in NYC, and even if i dont, its not worth reversing all my happiness in order to chase this. This role is overrated in my mind and he would always choose me first and avoid straining our relationship. 

Justin
You should go take this bc this is the role I wish i could get. Dont hedge  yoru bets and assume you can move back to NYC in a year. Who is the Annie you want to be? 

Mahesh
Anthropic PM who bounced back from Scale AI PM layoff. He was always able to find a job in NYC in PM that he liked. Has told me about agent PM roles at Sierra. He thinks that there are still AI startups in NYC. 

Vinny
Dont let outside opinions cloud your judgement and do wahts best for you. 


Context:
Ive been recruiting since last May with Scale / Peregrine offers, rejections from Etched/Tandem/Ramp/Traba, and I have been punted by Two Sigma / OpenRouter. 


What would it take to get conviction

one signal is eric deng was skeptical on them in the first place 
- like what separatest them from all the rest

#### Joining Fireworks AI FDPM
Worst case:

Median case: 

#### Staying in NYC
Median case:
I recruit for 3-5 more months (until February). 

What is available but I dont know if I can get is AI strategist at Sierra/Profound. 

three big domains of value:
i t


nitins framework:
- choosing stability/relationships/non-career sources of fulfillment
my framework:
- "hedonic treadmill"


- _If I stayed in NYC and turned down Fireworks/OpenAI, would I regret not taking the risk?_
    
- _If I moved to SF and the relationship ended, would I regret choosing career over love?_

it rlly is a choice of frameworks - 

do i choose love 
or do i choose career

when faced w a similar crossroads i chose nyc for my friends environment and creativity 

nyc is central to my happiness and creativity

i have chosen nyc before 


6-9 month structure

i can fly every 4 weeks

theres a couple options here
1. i take fireworks and its fully in sf 
2. i take openai and its fully in sf
3. i stay at microsoft in nyc and dont recruit for a bit
4. i stay at microsoft in nyc and heavily try for nyc based options
5. i take fireworks and i spend 3-6 months in sf 

previous instances of unhappiness is when i have chosen to go to cornell over 

i think to me sacrifice is
i will spend some time away from friends and family so i can build a better life for us

for nitin sacrifie is
i will give up some of my career gain to make sure i am still cose w my family

friend and social network is part of it

what do i actually want? i want a job that will fulfill me and a job in nyc

the truth is i dont care too much about ai infra. if it was a vertical w a product role i would be just as happy. this ai infa lean is solely based off of what ive done so far and what i think is a possibility 

fireworks is a n of 1 opportunity where its a
- forward deployed but core product role with pm mentorship 
- series b -> c where you get flexibility and ownership and can get bigger piece of the pie 
- this is the perfect transition period for a pm to rlly nail down the product logic

fireworks role seems very unique 
scale is something that i could give up cuz it was substitutable
fireworks is less so in this strike zone 

this is def different than both etched and scale and peregrine 

the only equivalent is if i reverse domains and i go for a harvey/rogo/elevenlabs
but there is slight tradeoff in hypeness or perceived pestigehere


the upside of fireworks:
- 

downside:
move to sf means:
- working 9-7 for five days a week 
- no hanging out with friends after work 
- taking the train to redwood city or living there
- working out very little 
- completely uprooting myself
- sacrificing the enjoyment of my relationship between me and nitin 
	- we only get to see each other for thanksgiving, christmas
	- very hard to call - i would call at 7PM my time 10PM his time 
	- very much depend on physical contact - our call convos are not great
- i will have to find new friends and a new network and a new community 
- 

judgement calls based on who and what we will be in the future:

if fireworks would giveme a 10x better job expeience in the next 3 yeas i would do it 

you either beileve you will find success in other ways 
or love in other people

do i trust that my happiness is independent of job outcomes and that being with the right person will make it all worth it?

the truth is 

i lack conviction i can find another job of this flavor 

and i have blind trust that me and nitin will work out if we're meant to work out
but he prob has blind trust that we will work out bc we will maek it work out

i genuinely believe in fireworks or at least the impat it would have on my career
+2 years at fireworks would be more impacful than +2 years at a scale/peregrine/etched/two sigma
what about at cursor/harvey/rogo/decagon? 

how do you forecast the future

i know new york is my life and happiness 
and you come to new york when you settle a bit on career

- **Fear 1:** Your relationship deteriorates due to distance. You imagine fights, feeling lonely, missing him, possibly breaking up.
    
- **Fear 2:** You move to SF, work like crazy, and your social/creative life suffers.
    
- **Fear 3:** You take the leap, but the job turns out less fulfilling than promised.
    
- **Impact:** Emotionally, you could feel **regret, isolation, guilt**, and social disconnection.

- **Professional:** Stretch, challenge, visibility, growth—something the current remote NYC role doesn’t fully offer.

- You may be avoiding moving to SF because it **feels like betraying your identity as someone who values relationships and a balanced life**.
    
- You may also be avoiding staying in NYC because it **feels like you’re settling or not ambitious enough**—which conflicts with your self-image as a high-achieving PM.

what is a hell yes for what id take over fireworks in nyc:
- PM @ exciting startup
	- PM in healthtech
	- PM in fintech
- PM @ Two Sigma 
- PM @ hedgefund
is it so bad to wait 2-3 years and stay in nyc over moving for a startup
