title: "fundamental primitives"
---

calendar+ email are the most fundamental primitives for communication
yet the way we use them are simplistic at best
https://poetical.day/
i love experiments that play with the absurdity of using them to their limits
calendar invite as a love language, calendar invite as a form of communication
email as a form of storage, as a form of analysis, etc. 
they are open box inputs of communication that lack the social graph / recommendation networks of most sociasl
and thus are the most special "social media" of all

*email as social media*

*calendar as social media*

*lists as social media*
