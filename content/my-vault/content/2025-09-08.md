i would move for openai 
but would i move for fireworks? 

pro con list between openai and fireworks

openai 
- theyre looking for ppl who have demonstrated operational excellence thru chaos
- ppl have thrived in chaos and gritty and chaos 
- we wonder about ppl who coming from big companies - maybe things are too many swim lanes
- ppl have seen enough crazy to thrive in this environment
- want ppl who enjoy that environment
- dig into the conflicts and challenging in situation
- adults in the room who arent afraid to disagree
- ppl who work well a team
- when talk about things that you built - when you say "we" vs "the team" the team did something
they see ppl fail on:
- ppl dont communicate clearly or succintly
- be concise and to the point
- massive meetings scheduled for 20 min
- try not to ramble
- take a step back 
- methodically instead of robotic
avoid rabbit holes:
- when you talk about the project - when its too high level team think its handwavey
- too detailed - its too in the weeds
- try to go midlevel - can go up and down the convo depending on where 
process design:
- how you solve problems and the type of questions you ask
- dealing with ambiguety 
- hwo do you do program management
- how well do you understand 
cross functional
- ability to collaborate well w other functions and teams
- how do you determine roles of other ppl
- how do u deal with decisoins
- how do you execute
- conflicts and challlenges
- cross functional confclits when ppl 

behavioral 
- read openai charter - careers page there is a value statement and operating principles link - stories that illustrate how you handle 
- understand your motivations

TPM Systems Design 
- a project that you led
- dont worry if it relates to if relates to here
- they will ask questions to dig deeper into technical details
- prioritize things you can understand clearly
- bring slides
- want to show large scope is better 
- bigger the thing you do - the crazier you seen 
- when ur looking for a senior person 
- wanted someone who can take on more 
- see the ambiguity on their own 
- no guidelines 

feedback from kenny:
- junior side
- you have a lot of context on oai on maintenance
- like how yu understand large scal emaintenance
- like you had many ideas
- like you had experience upgrading gb200
- a lot of insights on how to 

- not the most technical 
- when you were asked about how to track cluster maintenance across you said dashboard
