the planning fallacy 
- _Coordination neglect_
- The failure to think about how hard it is to put stuff together when other people are involved. And so that can make the planning fallacy bigger and badder when there are teams of people trying to finish work on time
- Don’t think about it too much. Look back. Look back at all the projects you’ve done, all the projects that are similar to this new project X, and look historically at how well those projects performed in terms of their plan versus their actual. See how accurate you were, and then use that shift or use that uplift to adjust your new project that you’re about to start

Tracking and scoring the difference between forecasts and outcomes — that trend owes a lot to this man:


 “strategic misrepresentation.”

- - > _And you need the data. And you need to apply it in a sensible way, you need to identify those similar projects. What is my reference class? You know it’s not going to be just a bunch of projects with very different characteristics.
