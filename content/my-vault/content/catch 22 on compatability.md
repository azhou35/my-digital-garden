title: "catch 22 on compatability"
---

Well that’s a good question. It almost feels like there’s this weird [catch 22](https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/catch-22) around commitment and people. On one hand you don’t really know how compatible you are with someone until you spend a lot of time with them. On the other hand, it’s hard to know if you want to commit to someone until you know how compatible you are with them. There’s a whole realm of theory around [optimal stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping) that tries to solve this in a rigorous and mathematical way (reject the first n people you date, etc.) but I still feel a calculus of the heart will always end up missing things.
