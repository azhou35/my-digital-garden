title: "my rooming bio"
---


hihi i'm annie, graduated from cornell last december! i work in tech as a pm fully remote. looking for a roomie (or 2) in manhattan, move-in date flexible (anywhere from aug - dec). i'm an early bird who cooks often, and keep shared spaces tidy. my ideal roommate is down to be good friends, perhaps host fun hangs, and even explore hobbies together (photography/drawing/cooking/writing). extra plus if we both work hybrid schedules so we can cowork at times! 

my ig is @anni.ezzz, lmk if there's a good fit:)
