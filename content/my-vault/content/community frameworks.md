when should communities scale?
there is an ideal *k* value for the number of people in a healthy & self-sustaining community.
i am proficient in cultivating groups of 10-15 -- doing the upfront work to curate the people, spearhead events, create that creative space. 
but i always struggle to get it to 30+ people who are actively engaged.

photography community:
* photowalks
* photo exhibit 

writing community:
- running bi-weekly writing clubs in order to foster conversation and accountability.
