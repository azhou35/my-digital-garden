title: "perfect memory short story"
---

Pitch: 
[[perfect memory script]]
a speculative short story where it's 20 years into the future and we have uploaded our memories into the cloud, allowing for perfect memory. after a traumatic breakup, you are given the choice to roll back your consciousness to before you ever met the person. in choosing to do so you constantly feel this ache in your memory - you can't remember certain facts or details, but you feel that you've had this memory before. you feel this persistent deja vu. 
2. "Emotional Rollback" 
	1. Idea that our states are preserved within github-like instances, and we can "rollback" to a state preceeding a checkpoint
	2. Someone wants to forget an uncomfortable breakup and rolls back
	3. what if u tried to roll back ur last iteration pre breakup - heart has its own memory separate from brain * We’ve only done small rollbacks before - to do so many at once is irresponsible and crazy * Friend sarah has done it before, and shes so much happier it seems * Scene 1: doing the rollback * 2: memory glitches * 3: full breakdown * 4: seeing him again, resolution and acceptance *

Questions:
* pain and joy cannot be surgically separated
* - Are we destined to make the same choices, even after forgetting?
- The idea that some connections might be so fundamental that they reassert themselves
Decision Points:

plot themes:

all water has perfect memory
"the heart has perfect memory"
persistence of memory - even when we try to forget it returns to us like memory foam, we are doomed to return to the state of the crime 
What I understand now is that I could never escape from my love for S, nor would I want to. To be loved by him, to love and care for him, is neither my birthright or destiny. It’s the groove worn into the earth by repetitive pacing over thousands of days. It’s the room I’m locked in that I can never get out of. It’s the room that I would return to if someone forced me out. It’s luck. I can’t believe how lucky I’ve been. To repay luck, I think you have to live in gratitude. I don’t know what my relationship with S will be five years from now. Maybe we’ll be in relationships with other people and not talk to each other. I don’t think we always get to choose how these things play out, and I try to live contentedly in the mystery of life. But I feel grateful always for what I’ve been fortunate enough to experience.
