# INTRODUCTION SCRIPT

"Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this case today. Before we dive in, I'd like to outline my approach:

1. First, I'll make sure I understand the problem we're solving by restating the case question and clarifying any assumptions.
    
2. Next, I'll structure my analysis using a framework that best fits the situation - whether that's examining the problem-diagnosis-solution pathway, analyzing process-people-technology components, or another approach depending on the specific challenge.
    
3. Throughout our discussion, I'll be thinking about how Tandem's AI technology can transform the prior authorization landscape by addressing key pain points:
	    * XX*
4. I'll then share data-driven recommendations that balance operational feasibility with strategic impact, focusing on metrics like reduced abandonment rates, provider time savings, and improved patient outcomes.
    

Is this approach aligned with your expectations? And before we begin, may I ask a few clarifying questions about the case?"

## CLARIFYING QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

- "Are we focusing on a specific therapeutic area or specialty?"
- "What metrics would be most important for measuring success?"
- "Is there a specific stakeholder perspective we should prioritize?"
- "What constraints should I be aware of in developing solutions?"
- "What stage is Tandem at with this particular challenge/opportunity?"

# TANDEM CASE INTERVIEW FRAMEWORK

## PRIOR AUTHORIZATION CONTEXT

- **Definition**: Insurance approval process for medications/treatments
- **Key Metrics**:
    - 400-800M prescriptions require PA annually
    - 2-10 days average processing time
    - 20-30% initial denial rate (40% for complex drugs)
    - $40B+ administrative cost industry-wide
    - 10-20% prescription abandonment rate

## CORE FRAMEWORKS

### 1. PROBLEM-DIAGNOSIS-SOLUTION (PDS)

- **Problem**: Clearly define the issue (metrics, impact, scope)
    - _Example_: "7-day PA delays causing 15% prescription abandonment"
- **Diagnosis**: Root cause analysis using data
    - _Example_: "Manual form processing, missing data, error-prone workflow"
- **Solution**: Tandem's AI-driven approach with quantifiable benefits
    - _Example_: "AI automation reduces processing to 2 days, cuts abandonment by 50%"

### 2. PROCESS-PEOPLE-TECHNOLOGY (PPT)

- **Process**: Map current workflow, identify bottlenecks
    - _Steps_: Prescription → PA submission → Review → Decision → Fulfillment
    - _Bottlenecks_: Form completion, information gathering, manual reviews
- **People**: Stakeholder analysis (who's involved, pain points)
    - _Stakeholders_: Patients, doctors, staff, insurers, pharmacies
    - _Pain Points_: Time burden, administrative costs, patient care delays
- **Technology**: Tandem's AI solution addressing specific gaps
    - _Features_: Auto-form completion, error detection, approval prediction

### 3. MARKET OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS

- **Size**: Quantify TAM/SAM/SOM
    - _Example_: "$73B oncology PA market with 40% denial rate"
- **Competition**: Current landscape assessment
    - _Example_: "Manual PA services with 7-day turnaround vs. Tandem's 2-day AI approach"
- **Strategy**: Differentiated approach to win market share
    - _Example_: "Partner with specialty clinics, target high-denial therapeutic areas"

### 4. HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN APPROACH

- **Hypothesis**: Initial assumption based on available data
    - _Example_: "Manual data entry causes 70% of PA delays"
- **Test**: How to validate the hypothesis
    - _Example_: "Analyze time spent by step in current PA workflow"
- **Analyze**: Data-driven evaluation
    - _Example_: "Form completion takes 4 of 7 days, AI reduces to 1 day"
- **Recommend**: Clear, actionable next steps
    - _Example_: "Implement AI form completion to achieve 2-day turnaround"

## VALUE PROPOSITION ELEMENTS

- **Speed**: Faster PA turnaround (7→2 days)
- **Accuracy**: Reduced denial rates (30%→10%)
- **Affordability**: Patient assistance when insurance denies
- **ROI**: Provider time savings, reduced abandonment, higher fill rates

## CLOSING STRUCTURE

1. Summarize key findings
2. Propose recommendation with clear metrics
3. Address implementation considerations
4. Outline expected results/timeline
5. 
Here’s a concise summary of the case frameworks we’ve covered for your Tandem Strategy and Operations interview prep. Perfect for your notes—simple, clear, and ready to use!

1. Problem-Diagnosis-Solution (PDS)

• When: Fixing operational issues (e.g., slow PA). • Steps: 1 Problem: Define it (e.g., “7-day PA delay”). 2 Diagnosis: Why? (e.g., manual forms, missing data). 3 Solution: Fix it (e.g., “Tandem’s AI cuts to 2 days”). • Example: “PA takes 7 days → manual work’s the issue → AI automates it to 2 days.”

2. Process-People-Technology (PPT)

• When: Improving workflows (e.g., reducing abandonment). • Steps: 1 Process: Map the flow (e.g., PA → denial → abandonment). 2 People: Who’s involved? (e.g., doctors miss info, patients give up). 3 Technology: Tandem’s AI fix (e.g., auto-fills, finds discounts). • Example: “30% abandonment → doctors lack time, patients can’t pay → AI perfects forms, cuts to 10%.”

3. Market Opportunity (Size-Competition-Strategy)

• When: Growth/expansion (e.g., new PA market). • Steps: 1 Size: How big? (e.g., $73B oncology PA market). 2 Competition: Who’s there? (e.g., manual firms lag). 3 Strategy: How to win? (e.g., “AI targets clinics”). • Example: “Oncology PAs → $73B, high denials → AI cuts denials, partners with drugmakers.”

4. Hypothesis-Driven Analysis

• When: Any case needing focus (e.g., delays, denials). • Steps: 1 Hypothesis: Guess the issue/fix (e.g., “Delays from manual work”). 2 Test: Check it (e.g., “Forms take 4 days?”). 3 Analyze: Numbers/logic (e.g., “AI cuts 4 to 1 day”). 4 Recommend: Confirm (e.g., “AI hits 2 days”). • Example: “7-day PA → manual forms are key → AI fixes it to 2 days.” Quick Notes Version • PDS: Problem → Why → Fix (operations). • PPT: Process → People → Tech (workflows). • Market: Size → Competition → Strategy (growth). • Hypothesis: Guess → Test → Solve (focused thinking). All tie to Tandem’s AI for PA speed, denials, or affordability. Pick one based on the case, mention Tandem’s tech, and you’re golden! Need a sample note format?


What Is Prior Authorization (PA)? Prior authorization is a process where insurance companies require approval before they’ll cover certain medications or treatments. It’s like needing your parents’ okay before buying an expensive video game—they want to ensure it’s worth it and not just a whim. Core Idea: • Gatekeeper: Insurance decides if a drug is “necessary” or if a cheaper alternative works. • Goal: Save money and ensure proper use. How It Works 1 Doctor Prescribes: “You need this $2,000/month diabetes drug.” 2 Insurance Steps In: “Hold up—prove it’s essential. Send us details.” 3 Paperwork: Doctor submits forms with patient info (e.g., medical history, failed cheaper drugs). 4 Decision: ◦ Approved: Insurance pays (maybe you pay $30 copay). ◦ Denied: You’re stuck with full cost or no drug. Example: • You need a $5,000 cancer med. Insurance says, “Show us lab results and proof you tried chemo first.” It takes 7 days to sort out—if they say no, you’re out of luck unless you’ve got cash. Key Facts • Volume: Of ~4 billion U.S. prescriptions yearly, 10–20% (400–800 million) need PA—mostly specialty drugs (e.g., $5,000–$10,000/month for cancer, arthritis). • Time: Averages 2–10 days per PA; longer if errors occur. • Denials: 20–30% rejected at first (40% for complex drugs). • Cost: Admin work costs $50–$100 per PA—a $40 billion U.S. problem. Why It’s a Big Deal • Delays: Waiting a week for a heart med can mean ER visits. • Abandonment: 10–20% of patients ditch prescriptions due to hassle or cost. • Frustration: Doctors and staff hate the paperwork grind. Real-Life Pain: • A kid needs a $1,000 asthma inhaler. PA takes 5 days, forms miss a test result, it’s denied. Parents wait another week or pay full price—meanwhile, the kid’s wheezing. Who’s Affected • Patients: Delayed care, higher costs if denied. • Doctors: Extra work (hours on forms). • Pharmacies: Can’t dispense until approved. • Insurers: Control spending but slow things down. • Drug Companies: Lose sales if PAs fail. Tandem’s Connection (Quick Note) Tandem uses AI to fix PA: • Faster: Cuts 7 days to 2 by auto-filling forms. • Smarter: Reduces denials (30% to 10%) by catching mistakes. • Cheaper: Finds discounts if insurance won’t pay. In a Nutshell PA is insurance’s way to say “prove it” before covering costly drugs. It’s slow, error-prone, and a headache for everyone. Tandem’s AI swoops in to make it quick and painless—key context for your interview! Need a case to practice this? You’re set to impress!
