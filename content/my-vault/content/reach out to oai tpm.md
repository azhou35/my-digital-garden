hey anuj! saw your post about building large computers and hosting massive ai workloads. i've actually been in that exact space! i'm currently at microsoft azure's ai supercomputing team where i've been: * optimizing those exact gpu supercomputing infrastructures you're talking about * improving operational slas from 90% to 95% for openai (kinda important these days, right?) * helping scale genomics/research workloads on our baremetal platforms been extending azure's capabilities for some of the heaviest ai compute users out there - basically helping build those "biggest supercomputers the world's ever seen hopefully" type of systems. prior to this had some time at aws and an ai legal tech startup, so i've seen different angles of the cloud/ai stack. dm me if you want to chat about how i could help scale whatever massive thing you're working on. i'm definitely interested. - annie
