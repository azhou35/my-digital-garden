### Step 1: Identify the core challenges
- Provider APi inconsistencies
- Diff networking models/security paradigms/resource naming conventions
- Varying SLAs, availability zones, failure modes
- Cost Optimization across diff pricing models 
- compliance requirements that differ by region/provider

Create Key Requirements:
- abstract away provider differences for developers
- maintain provider specific optimizations where needed
- enable workload portability and disaster recovery
- unified monitoring, logging, cost visibility 
### Step 2: System Architecture
Core Components:
1. Abstraction Layer / Control Plane
	1. Unified API that translates high level deployment specs to provider specific configurations
	2. Resource toplogy engine to understand cross cloud dependency
	3. Poliyc engine for placement decsions (cost, latency, compliance)
2. Provider adapters
	1. Individual modules for each cloud proider
	2. Handle authentication, rate limits, provider specific quirks
	3. Implement retry logic and error handling 
3. Resource statement management
	1. Distributed state store to track resources across all providers
	2. Drift detection to identify when actual state diverges from desired state 
4. Orchestration engine
	1. Workflow engine that handles complex deployments and dependnecies
	2. Rollback capabilities and circuit breakers
### Techical Implementation 
Phase 1 - Foundation 
- Core abstraction layer w 2-3 major providers
- Unified resource modeling 
- Basic CRUD operations
Phase 2 - Intelligene
- implement placement policies 

Success metrics:
- Time to deployment
