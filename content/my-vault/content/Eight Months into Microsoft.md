After one year, I want to 1) get promoted 2a) be on the pathway to more scope, a different team (Aditya's team), or 2b) find a TPM job at a smaller / in-person company or a PM role. 

Emotional Thoughts:
* I feel like a glorified SQL monkey / security mule. Nothing I do on a day-to-day-basis, if I described out loud, aligns with what I imagined a PM to be. I am *managing* processes, for sure. 
* I get tasks to do (related to data/security) and execute them. But I am not working with any developers on roadmaps, nor interacting with designers. 

What do I want out of my job?
* I am driven by a desire to be part of a project / role that makes an impact. 

My ideal job:
* **Interesting Domain** where I work on solving a cool problem (e.g. AI infra / edtech / )
* **Doing a mix of tasks** -- conducting user interviews with customers, giving feedback to designs, working with engineers on their roadmap, **writing documentation like blogs and steps**. 
* **Talking to senior leadership or feeling like my tasks or doing something**

**My expectations post OAI Engagement** 
* Generally feel more engaged with work.
