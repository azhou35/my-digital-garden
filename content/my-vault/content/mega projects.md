- Global megaproject spending is estimated at **$6–9 trillion per year**, ~**8% of global GDP**.
- - Megaprojects are **recession-proof**: downturns often _increase_ them via stimulus spending.
- why we built them bc they fulfill 4 sublimes
	- Political sublime – monuments, visibility, legacy, re-election
	- Technological sublime – pushing boundaries (“largest, fastest, tallest”)
	- Economic sublime – jobs, contracts, profits, unions, capital flows
	- Aesthetic sublime – iconic design and cultural symbolism
- breakfix model
	- projects are fixed after breaking
	- ➡️ The Hiding Hand is itself a form of **optimism bias**.
	- - Projects are selected based on **who lies best on paper**, not actual value.
