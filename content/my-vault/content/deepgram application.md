Growing up with immigrant parents who struggled with language barriers, I witnessed firsthand how voice and language differences created real obstacles in their daily lives. I remember watching my parents rehearse phone calls before making them, anxious about being misunderstood or missing critical information because of their accents. These experiences instilled in me a deep appreciation for the power of voice technology to bridge communication gaps.
This personal connection to speech recognition sparked my interest in NLP, which I explored professionally at AWS working with language processing tools. Recently, I've investigated the power of voice AI in writing use cases, as I've partnered with companies like Cartesia to think through their custom voice feature. 
Deepgram tackles the more fundamental challenge of building speech intelligence infrastructure that works for everyone, regardless of accent or speech pattern—a mission that resonates deeply with my background. I'm impressed by their wide language support, as someone who's often struggled adapting voice API projects at AWS with my parents in mind, as it often lacked support for Mandarin. 
I'm convinced that multimodality represents the essential next frontier for AI, and Deepgram is positioned at exactly the right layer to make this future possible—by solving the hard, fundamental problems of speech intelligence that others are working around rather than addressing directly


Growing up with immigrant parents who struggled with language barriers, I witnessed firsthand how voice and language differences created real obstacles. When my mother was hospitalized last year, I requested a Mandarin-speaking doctor to help her understand the proposed procedures. With no translator at hand, crucial medical terminology was lost in translation. Watching her nod along while clearly not fully comprehending her treatment plan was both frustrating and frightening.

I'm a techno-optimist, and my joy for product development stems from uplifting the people in my community who are underserved. When I saw Deepgram's recent launch of Nova-3, I was genuinely excited about the real-world impact this technology could have for families like mine.

I've explored NLP tools at AWS and recently collaborated with Cartesia on voice AI for content creators, but Deepgram's focus on building fundamental speech intelligence infrastructure that works across languages and specialized domains resonates more deeply with my personal mission. I'm particularly impressed by Deepgram's support for languages like Mandarin and depth in verticals like healthcare that many other platforms neglect.

I'm convinced that multimodality is the essential next frontier for AI, and Deepgram is positioned at exactly the right layer to make this future possible—I want to join its mission and build empathetic products that can reinvent a new paradigm of communication.



This personal experience made me realize how voice AI could transform healthcare accessibility.  Medical with its 63.7% reduction in word error rates for medical terminology, I was genuinely excited about the real-world impact this technology could have for families like mine.

While my work at AWS exploring NLP tools and my recent collaboration with Cartesia on voice AI for content creators has been valuable, Deepgram's focus on building fundamental speech intelligence infrastructure that works across languages and specialized domains resonates more deeply with my personal mission. I'm particularly impressed by Deepgram's support for languages like Mandarin that many other platforms neglect.
