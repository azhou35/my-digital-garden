**HAVI Priority Areas**

HAVI encourages projects that will lead to:

- Specific outcomes seen by the field as major steps forward, solutions to longstanding problems, or innovative approaches that open up entirely new pathways of inquiry.
- Construction of datasets (or new methods of data acquisition / construction) with properties that reduce or eliminate current problems in AI.  Dataset construction should include use cases and validation approaches.
- Integration of humanities approaches and agency in AI model training, construction, and usage.
- Exploration of AI-based approaches that the field sees as risky, but with high impact if successful.
The following instances are meant to guide project development but are not an exhaustive or limiting list of topics. Successful projects in this priority area could, for example:

- Develop methods that resist trends toward monoculturalism.
- Challenge cultural standardization and mitigate bias in models, data, pipelines.
- Address the limits of encoding, embedding and tokenization.
- Develop a suite of benchmarks to evaluate a model’s ability to generate outputs that are historically specific or culturally representative. 
- Develop novel approaches to ablate and control for historical or cultural knowledge from pretrained models. 
- Assuming the existence of culturally or historically representative AI systems, devise simulation-based experiments to measure the impact of counterfactual events or circumstances.
- Use socially validated models to measure the social effects of similar narrative forms (the novel, lyric poetry) or story types across diverse cultural contexts.
- Engage multi-lingual, indigenous languages, and epistemological paradigms – with focus on unique approaches across “low density languages” that can answer important questions for those communities / repositories / corpora.
- Allow LLMs to operate in multiple languages at the same time, making explicit the differences and similarities that are rooted in the nuance and uniqueness of language structure, and seeking to understand the breadth and depth of connection of linguistic differences to resulting features in trained models.
- Advance AI-inspired approaches to the study of visual art, photography, film, TV, advertisements, theater, dance, social media, video essays, (video) oral histories, and animation.
- Incorporate multimodal data into domain-specific datasets and models (e.g., healthcare/medical) to address issues such as mistrust, precision outputs, inclusion of narratives, images, historical documents.
- Develop and advance core technical objectives (object detection, pose estimation, image and temporal segmentation) with new culturally-specific, humanities-relevant models.
- Explore new data and models for cultural phenomena that have so far eluded measurement. 
- Build outputs (e.g., datasets, models, software systems) that will form a core set of future building blocks for the field.
