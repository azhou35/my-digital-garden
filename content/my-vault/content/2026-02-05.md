Due to upcoming business priorities, we’re considering a short-term pause (“no-fly zone”) on full-cluster maintenances that impact Applied capacity through 2/19 so we can protect capacity during the next couple weeks.
Concretely, this would mean holding any maintenance that takes an entire Applied cluster offline.

What is permissible to proceed during this window:
Research-only cluster maintenancesPartial / node-level (<32 nodes/daily) maintenancesIf you have a full-cluster maintenance currently scheduled before 2/19, please flag it so we can line up on timing.


Capacity delivered 
Sites with multiple lines - multiple commitments 

We need to level set on two things
1) any sort of ultraserver level interruption should be considered as a disruptive event.
	1) until we are able to move towards impactless updates or a smaller level of impact
	2) our posture with other csps is that if the update is not breakfix - we defer on these updates
		1) this includes security deployments and im happy to chat with any security stakeholders to get that message thru
2) upcoming nfz maintenances
