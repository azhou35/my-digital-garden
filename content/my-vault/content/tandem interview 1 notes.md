u r working at a team ata large pharma company 
drug that ur team is launching a biologic 
drug derived by living organisms 
patients w severe and cr
treat patietns
cyrasis - skin conditions
typically diagnosed by dermatalogist
ready to go to market

first wanna estimate
potential year 1 
cyrasis - common skin condition - huge variability
low medium and high severity cases
medium and high 
pretty uniform 


- goal is to determine the year 1 revenue 
- revenue is profit - costs 
- yr 1 market size -> amount to sell -> amount of cost
- top lines
- and bring it all together 
- assumptions
- thorn of that market u identify 
	- mature company 
	- competitive landscae
	- cyrasis
	- pills, topica treatments
	- biologics 
	- fairly fragmented
	- strong severity cases
	- high severity
	- other drugs
questions:
1. frequency of drug
2. pricing sensitivities
3. side effects 

add one more
number of prescriptions that get written
our drug is a specialty drug 
when come to market
huge dropoff rate
from point doctor writes prescription to when it gets dispensed

20,000 prescriptions 
only 25% get fulfilled at a pharmacy 
20% of patients who may drop off (nonadherent)
they drop off halfway thru the year

drug is $10k a year per dose
doses administered monthly 
60k if dropped off 
complete

% of prescriptions *  % of patients*.8 * 120k  = ppl 
480M
20M 
=120k 

drop off
60M
2M 
=540M
increase revenue
invest in 
1. marketing to doctors to increase top of funnel
2. **patient assistance programs improvement fulfillment**
3. patient adherent

move to fulfilment
