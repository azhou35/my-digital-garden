title: "doppelgangers"
---

are unsettling because they serve as projections of who you could be.

> in elementary school everyone called me and M twins, because we were both asian girls with dora haircuts. at first it drew us closer together. but it incubated a deep-seeded invisible duel - M became my benchmark. i wanted to take the classes M did, do the clubs she did, go to the same high school. M was better at math and me with writing; M excelled in music while i liked to paint. but i still tried out for the math team and picked up the clarinet, and when she inevitably outpaced me i felt a deep insecurity. all the way through high school - we gunned for the same leadership positions, the same limited spots on the math modeling team. i got class council and she got tsa officership in freshman year. i gunned for finance club president almost selfishly, just because i knew she wanted it and i wanted to beat her for once. 
> we were never that alike in personality. she was stubborn and confrontational, i was shy and relentlessly people-pleasing. it meant she could stand up for me, but it meant i couldn't stand up to her, nor express this mixed cocktail of envy and admiration i had for her.
