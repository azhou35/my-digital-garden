The winter darkness stings deeper in February, but I was born on a rare 72-degree day in early March. My mom entered the hospital wearing a bright yellow jacket—something she could shed away, along with anticipation. I think about this often: how we enter the world already shedding versions of ourselves.

At twenty-three, I'm learning that age isn't linear. Like Sandra Cisneros wrote about being eleven, I am simultaneously twenty-two, and eighteen, and eleven—carrying all my past selves in my bones. I find myself constantly mistaking sunrise for sunset, as if my life were 24 hours and I'm forever confused about which golden hour I'm witnessing.

## On Writing and Searching

I've spent my youth in a terrible hurry—to read all the books, see all the movies, listen to all the music. Always satiated but slightly hungry, chasing not knowledge but experience. The future perfect state that awaits at the end of the search. But what they don't tell you about growing up is that you never reach the end; you just learn to find beauty in the searching itself.

Sometimes when people ask my age, I say twenty-two with a sheepish grin. I simultaneously want to be older and ageless. Age-agnostic, perhaps, because I feel just as angsty and confused as I did at eleven, and probably will at thirty. Writing becomes my autopsy table—every word a clavicle, every sentence an organ—as I dissect my own becoming.

## On Friendship and Time's Generosity

What strikes me most about twenty-three is witnessing the generosity of time. Michelle making cookie batter the night before, Shirling waking up early to adorn a cake with flowers, Justin quietly clearing plates, Gary with his heavy-weight Sony capturing moments. Four different cameras of varying fidelities all trying to preserve the same light.

There's something profound about having people who allocate their precious time thinking about you. It's an inherent social contract, a mutual buy-in that says: your joy matters to me. As Bahar noted at my birthday gathering—it's really a reflection of who's in your life.

## On Light and Meaning-Making

Meaning-making functions as a daily wrestle with light. When I look at emptiness, all the coins inside me start rattling, restless. Li Young Lee once said—look at the birds: even flying is borne out of nothing. It's this prospect of flight that both terrifies and thrills me, an Icarian task.

The light is most golden just before the shadows fall. To be twenty-three is to stand in that penumbra, that hazy space between what was and what could be. In moments of blinding light, we have no idea what shape our shadows will take. Perhaps that's exactly where the beauty lies—in the not knowing, in the becoming, in the perpetual dawn-or-dusk of being young.

Humans, they frustrate me and delight me all at the same time. Perhaps that is what love is. Perhaps that is what growing up is.
