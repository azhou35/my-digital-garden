title: "notes on risk, upside, and gambling"
---

last week i visited vegas. 

on the uber ride someone tells me about visiting atlantic city, and how they opened a casino in the city that they shuttle all the old asian dads to. 

in *meet me in atlantic city* i learn about the car rides that pick up asian grandparents and shuttle them to casinos. 

games of luck are a double edged sword - they can foster playful competition within the asian community. see poker nights, mahjong club, etc.

at the worst case, they exacerbate poverty, loneliness, frustration. 

gambling is an activity that's present in the extremes of society. sort of like drugs. 

why is that?

there's also the invisible game. gambling for love of the game. psychological rewards beyond memory: rush of uncertainty, thrill of risk taking, momentary suspension of everyday concerns.

- community gathering space

	- They receive $45 casino credits which many sell to actual gamblers for around $38. After paying the $20 bus fare, they make about $18 profit - a small but crucial income supplement

''Some of the casinos discriminate against Chinese,'' said another bus regular, Hong Zhe Xu, 68. ''They don't help us if a machine breaks down or if we have a question. They just ignore us -- and it's not just a question of language, because they help other people who just gesture to them.''
