to do this week 
- sign up for amex 
- figure out orthopedics
- book vegas/relocation

why i chose openai over sierra
- extremely hard decision 
- walk you thru the decision in full transparency because it was incredibly difficult
- and i think it kinda boiled dwon to what i wanted for my next step 
- the main thing is that is since i work w the other team at openai 
- im sure its nontraditional to share so much about my decision process but i want to bc i really enjoy the sierra team and even if im not joining the team today i truly bbleieve as it grows its going to be very intentional and maintain this talent denstiy
- i see joining oai as a favor im doing for a team i work with wit ha clear need for my background and ill see thru scaling the progrma
- and i genuinely believe that sierra is on track to be a generational company and that its still going to be reaching exponentail growth 1-2 yrs in the future
- i think would have pushed me over the edge is joining the agent pm team which i dont know if it would have been accessible in a couple years 
- 

“First, I just want to say how much I’ve enjoyed getting to know the Sierra team. The culture you’re building feels really rare — the intentionality, the density of talent, the way you’ve treated me in this process. That’s why this was such an _extremely_ hard decision.

After a lot of thought, I’ve decided to move forward with OpenAI. The main reason is that I already work closely with their GPU Fleet team, and there’s an immediate need for my exact background. It feels like stepping into a role to see through a program I’ve already been deeply involved in, rather than making a clean new start.

That said, I genuinely believe Sierra is on track to be a generational company. I think the most exciting growth is still ahead of you, and I’d love to stay in touch and revisit joining once the company is a little further along.

I just want to thank you again for the time and enthusiasm you’ve shared with me. Even though I’m not joining today, I really hope to cross paths in the future.”

### 2. Future-Oriented Compliment (vision + alignment)

- “I really believe Sierra is on track to be a generational company. I imagine the most exciting inflection points will be in the next 1–2 years, and I’d love to be part of that journey when the timing aligns better.”

### 3. Relationship-Building (ongoing contact)

- “I’d love to stay in touch — even if I’m not on the team today, I’d really enjoy following Sierra’s journey more closely. Would it be okay if I checked in periodically?”

### 4. Mutual Value (showing you want to add, not just take)

- “If there are ever ways I can be helpful — making intros, sharing perspective from OpenAI infra, anything at all — I’d be glad to contribute while I follow Sierra from the outside.”
