[[social network theory]]
[[bookbear social network theory]]
fuzzy social choice theory:
* allows for degrees of pref / relationship strength between nodes 
1. fuzzy pref relations: nodes can have weights between 0 and 1
2. fuzzy weak preference relation - the degree in which node x is as good as or prefrred to node y
3. ambiguous/partial relationships
practical applications:
* community detection
* influence analysis
* coalition formation

computational considerations:
* how do you handle fuzzy arthimetic for calcuations on the network
* more complex algos needed vs binary relationships
* expressiveness vs computational complexity
