**daily scrum w damian**
- chloe is getting the validation completed for swithc hca and ufm
- still waiting to get the releases
- help us build the window
- present 
- switch upgrade- cant do it until we get bildout luster
- hca fw we dont even have 
- 1-2 weeks of testing
- incorrect ufm update
	- problematic in the version
	- is oai ok w the risk 
	- pblr is in the firm
- ib is ok w t

do ufm upgrade tmrw morning on phx 61 - enable plbr
validation complete - schedule impactufl outage
- upgrade ufm again to newer version
timeline 
- june 23 

getting comfortable with pblr readiness on 61 
how long we wanna allocate for validation
validation of switch os / ufm 
1 week to test - buildout cluster - validation 
we dont know when nvidia is gonna 
testing hca is blocked

even if gb200 hca stuff is fine
a week or so 
we wanna upgade 61 first

best case:
* ufm upgrade tmrw - everything looks good for a week
* target switch+ufm versions

ideal - 
if we think we're close try to push 
mana stuff - taken a fork of ofed
new release coming
refresh their fork
tracking waht theyre doing
lemme check in w them 
both latency and bandwidth issues that impact one of gpus

damian can describe the ib stuff 
technical issues
week following - fold in ib timeline with the other update


- 61 we need buildout 
- phx12/62 we've been testing just test on phx 12 that oai loans us 

summary updates:

for 61:

- ufm upgrade likely tmrw
- hca drop from nvidia next week
- validation for ib switch (~2-3 weeks to land buildout cluster + validation)

for 12/62:
* depends on confidence with pblr and needs to happen after above 61 updates for derisking
* hca: ? 
* validation for ib switch (cant get buildout cluster but will test on portion of phx12)
