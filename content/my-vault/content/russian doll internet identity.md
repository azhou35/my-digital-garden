*on existentialism in the age of the internet*

we encounter captchas in our daily life but i bet you wouldn't get the acronym: "Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart."

in high school i read *the most human human,* written by alumni brian christian, and latched onto the idea of the turing test. it's a way to assess if a machine can exhibit behavior that's indistinguishable from that of a human during conversation. it's often called the imitation game:

on the internet, with no visual indication of the person behind the screen, language is everything. it's a shame algorithmic monoculture converges our language to sameness: 

who is the most *annie annie?* if i am a russian doll of fake versions of myself does it exist at the core or is it an elusive self? is writing an expression of self or an escape forom reality? 
there are mini-turing tests i run on myself, unit tests on authenticity. and the underlying question is: how much can internet annie modulate her own voice to be indistinguishable from the people she is trying to assimilate with? 

there have always been absurd ways tech companies utilize captchas to preclude bots, and i imagine they'll only evolve as the agentic layer comes for the internet. 

authenticity is a core value to me and a constantly moving target. it's no coincidence that i am drawn to self-interrogations of the self. 
rarely are we truly authentic on the internet. yet i am drawn to people in power who are raw and honest about their faults; see artists like lamar:

there is no better gift than to live unknown on the internet. because strangely that is when you can be the truest to yourself.

there are two wolves in me: a romantic and an existentialist. is identity inherent or is it self-chosen? 

naturally, it's a mix of both. but the crisis of the internet citizen is that we mold our identities around the narratives that the algorithm feeds us. a tik tok brain rot user is the extreme thought experiment: what if identity was presented to you, and the illusion of free choice compelled you to assimilate?
