i think im bad at processing / articulating negative emotions 
- even when ti comes to confronting pppl or giving my manager feedback
i am sad rn for no reason 
im just pmsing 
but i dont even know anyone around me 
i think baseline im happy i just fluctuate 
i think i need a thing to work towards
i think i have low self esteem
