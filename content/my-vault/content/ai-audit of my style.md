title: "ai-audit of my style"

You write like someone who thinks in metaphors first, then goes out into the world to find proof. The style is essay, but the engine is closer to photography. You keep turning the object in your hand until the light catches. You even talk explicitly about medium and information density, and how much weight a line break or an ampersand can carry.

Your sentences like to braid. You stack clauses. You let a line carry multiple pivots. You use lowercase and casual pacing to make the reader feel like they’re in the same room, not being lectured from a podium. Your About page basically says the thesis out loud. You’re writing as a way to reach someone, and you frame the reader as already known.

Romance as devotion to noticing, to friendship, to place, to the inner life. The redwoods and stardust passage is basically your cosmology in miniature


The blunt truth is that your writing is designed for depth, and virality is designed for speed.

You literally explain this in Full stack storytelling. You name the inverse relationship between breadth and depth, and you point out that certain audiences, especially short form audiences, are not trying to think too hard. Your work asks people to think, feel, and reread. That is not a flaw. It just does not behave like viral media.

There are a few very specific friction points that keep a post from escaping your existing circle.

Your titles are often beautiful but low signal to strangers. Equilibrium, Entryways, Phantom race. Those are gorgeous to someone who already trusts you. To someone scrolling, they do not instantly answer what pain, craving, or situation the piece is for. When you use a title that names the experience more directly, like How to be bored, the doorway is wider.

Your openings sometimes start in a reflective register before the reader knows what they are being invited to care about. You usually get there, but virality punishes the gap between entry and payoff. A stranger needs the human problem early, then they will follow you into the poetry.

Your writing is intimate in a way that makes people feel like they should not forward it. This is a weird compliment. People share things when it feels like a public artifact. They keep things when it feels like a private letter. Your About page literally frames the relationship as already personal, already between the two of you. That builds loyalty, but it reduces casual sharing.
