do you still perform autopsies on conversations you’ve had lives ago?

[[zadie smith on writing]] says: 
identity is not a 2d slice and dice - rather, a temporal hyperdimensional function - which is why it's so frustrating to translate into 2d modes of communication

> To me, writing is always the attempted revelation of this elusive, multifaceted self, and yet its total revelation - as Zagajewski suggests - is a chimerical impossibility. It is impossible to convey all of the truth of all our experience. Actually, it's impossible to even know what that would mean, although we stubbornly continue to have an idea of it, just as Plato had an idea of the forms... In what form, asks the writer, can I most truthfully describe the world as it is experienced by this particular self? And it is from that starting point that each writer goes on to make their individual compromise with the self, which is always a compromise with truth as far as the self can know it. That is why the most common feeling, upon re-reading one's own work, is Prufrock's: "That is not it at all ... that is not what I meant, at all ..." Writing feels like self-betrayal, like failure.

a note on navel gazing 
you spend so much time looking inwards you almost fall into your own reflection. tormented by the volume of your personal echoes. why is it only when i hear the voices of others do i feel validated? i was always there.

writing is an act of identity making - every word, a clavicle, a femur, a sentence, an organ.

no wonder we call it a body of work

body as life sentence, punctured by formulaic division

recall  my previous sentiments, where substack felt like a void i shouted in. why is only when the ears of others perk up do i feel validated? my echoes were always there - the reflection of myself always in the river reflection. 
that people are here to hear me
i didn't feel comfortable calling myself a writer until i had external feedback - substack readers and organizing events around the practice. i've always been writing as a hobby. 

"To me, writing is always the attempted revelation of this elusive, multifaceted self, and yet its total revelation - as Zagajewski suggests - is a chimerical impossibility. It is impossible to convey all of the truth of all our experience"

i write towards a life sentence. i write myself into being. 

waste days navel-gazing to see my hair has worne thin. 
a pinnnacle of m writing career
