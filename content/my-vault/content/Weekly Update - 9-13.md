---

* feel a lot better going into work
	* its as simple as seeing ppl my age and we're all feeling decentralized and have this common culture to talk about
* feel weird about saying trite statements
	* i feel like i build a mini"brand" over being #deep so when i say something that's not super deep or well thought out i feel self conscious but idk why !!!
* week 1 of relationship :') 
	* def feels so diff than prev relationships, not toxic andtook it slow to rly get to know the person
