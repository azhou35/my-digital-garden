My overall intention is to 
1) baodega and supper clubs
Chinese food is not a monolith -
I'd like to explore how chefs are challenging monolithic views with hyper-specific regional dishes. I'd interview Charlene Luo who runs Baodega, a supper club she runs out of her Bed-Stuy 2-bedroom apartment. 
There are several angles here: the post-pandemic rise of supper clubs as spaces for cultural reconnection, the intense return to cultural traditions (e.g. drying out sausages on the roof) to preserve authenticity, even the rise of second-gen Asian Americans leaving corporate jobs to hone into their cultural creativity practices. It's an answer to digital loneliness - strangers rub shoulders and share communal dishes, remniscent of *family style* in Chinese tradiiton, serve each other wine, and the chef is the host who cares about your eating experience. I can explore the post-pandemic rise of supper clubs as spaces for cultural reconnection, as Luo quit her corporate job mid-pandemic to focus on cooking. This is a space that embaces Chinese traditions: taking shoes off before you enter the home. I have questions to ask - how do you breathe your own perspective on cultural traditions, how do you think of your own branding as a self-made chef, etc. Could interview dining attendees for more color. 

	1) chinese cuisine is not a monolith - honoring family cooking with a specificity deeper than u could have
	2) Challenge the monolithic perception of Chinese food by profiling chefs/hosts who spotlight hyper-specific dishes (e.g., Hakka, Fujianese) rarely seen in NYC restaurants
	3) e.g. Interview Lucas Sin or Baodega hosting pop-ups, discussing their culinary heritage and how they build community
	4) Post-pandemic rise of supper clubs as spaces for cultural reconnection
2) hungry thirsty
	1) Handover process between a beloved neighborhood spot from a retiring owner to a new team
	2) Joint convo around old owner and incoming team. opening up a establishment off the tails of the prev owner (handover process)
	3) how do you honor regulars’ memories while attracting new crowds
3) cultural wine bars 
	1) sinsa, **La Rai** 
Asian regions are not particularly well-renown for being wine regions - yet there's a surge in cultural-themed wine bars in the city. Natural wine’s boom meets Asian cultural roots—e.g., how fish-sauce caramel pairs with skin-contact whites. I'd love to interview a host of people - Richard Jang from Sinsa, the Mam / Di and Di team behind La Rai. Questions to ask include - how do you cultivate a mysterious yet culturally accurate space within the competitive nightlife scene? I'd like to explore the delicate balance between authenticity and accessibility in design and atmosphere. This piece would also examine how these spaces challenge traditional wine culture hierarchies.


How do you develop a vibe within the city? How do you reinterpret traditional Asian drinking customs? , or how communal drinking mirrors rice-wine rituals.
