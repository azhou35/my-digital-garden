title: "timepiece prototypes"
---

ideas:
- a way to project ur current gcal schedule to a cool vintage website?
- a way to take the calendar and visualize what types of activites you do?
- what if we could map our attention 
- how do we encourage ourself to take our time? can we build a tool to intentinoally make u wait?
- the clouds moving across the sky emulating real life
- metaphors of time
	- time is a river
	- time is a mother
	- time is thief
	- flow of time
	- time is money
- Something I never really noticed before is that we only use our calendars to look forward in time, never to reflect on things that happened in the past. That feels like a missed opportunity.
