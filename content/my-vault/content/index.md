### 🌱 Genesis
 Planted 10/27/24 in NYC. Last watered 10/6/2025.
### 🤠 Welcome!
I'm Annie. 

I grew up in Jersey, spent time in upstate New York, and now split my time between NYC and SF. I'm drawn to cities, systems, and the people and processes that keep them alive. I'm a techno-optimist who cares about making technology accessible for people of all backgrounds. In undergrad, I wrote learning materials for AI4ALL and contributed to open-source NLP tools.

I've been using Obsidian as my [note-taking system](notetaking) since November 2024. I periodically publish high-fidelity notes & works-in-progress on this [[digital garden]]. 

I believe in file over app, the hummanness of the em dash, and notes as building blocks for bigger ideas.
