title: "bloodline"
---

i remember rushing through my food at the dinner table. picking at the tender slices of hong xiao ruo coaxed with my mother's love, shoveling rice down my throat in anticipation of something so much more important to get back to - my interrupted google chats or rotting calculus homework and the like. 

it's late at night and parents come by the apartment, wielding tupperware containers of fresh food from home. we perch atop hightop chairs and a mini circular table to eat the goods. 

as the story goes he came to new york at 23 with only $100 in his pocket. my mom saw how big the pints of hagen daz were here and her eyes bulged into saucers, inciting unlucky stomachache on her first day here. 

*my vision swims when i look at the computer,* he admits, idly peeling a clementine onto a plate full of bones. i can't keep up with you young folk. 

my vision swims as he goes on and on, telling me how proud he is of me, unconsciously pressing wedges of orange into my hands. *im getting old these days* and i swallow the need to say *you used to say older, why are you saying old now?*

----

all i want to do is make these people proud. these people who pray for my successes over the dinner table, long after my seat has vacated, hands pressed in service of a fish, wishing on a wishbone they pluck and hope that it breaks. 

the bloodline of a fish is referred to as a thin strip of muscular tissue that runs down its lateral. a thin bloodline means the fish bled properly - a thick one indicates that it died on the line.

our family loves fish and we serve it whole, in all its unkempt glory - fins and tail still attached, big bulging fish eye staring back at you, glassy in its mortality. this time in japan we were able to fish for our own dinner and we did it with glee, peering over the glass to see which prize we would take home. but it came served to us with perfectly packaged.

i no religion except sunday mornings in the fish section at the chinese supermarket, when the catch was freshest and you could haggle the price. linoelum floors caked in residue and the sting of fluorescent lighting stinging your eyes, your eyes peering into their eyes, bulbous spheres like a twisted crystal ball. what futures do we allow ourselves to imagine? i too have fish-like tendencies, when asked to peer into the future, my bottom lip suspended in disbelief & my eyes glossing over. 

at 23 my dad immigrated to the upper west side, north of 76th street, for his masters class in the city. he never went to classes because he had to pay back the accumulating student debt - so he hopped on his bike to deliver asian food up and down manhattan. 

broadway cuts its way down manhattans backbone. city as fish. splayed into two pieces. i 

at 23 i sit at the bottom of manhattan, where riches pool at the feet.

any friend who visits my apartment comments that it feels very *lived in.* almost chinese. the wash of secondhand mahagony wood and abundance chinese spoons, unapologetic scarcityof forks. my table is tiny, now, bartop and circular in the entryway corner. a friend comments he could picture it as the perfect stage for a chinese family dinner: a melange of small plates, plenty of seared vegetables and scoops of rice.   

there's so much of the world they haven't yet explored. such few days they've spent in china - with such few vacation days, they spent all of them taking me to cool western places, dubai, italy, spain. i hated going back to their hometown. 

what is a bloodline if not an invisible red string tying you from past to future? one that laces around your throat and constricts, ever so slightly, a feeling of pressure you can never shake away. 


they say there's still so much of the world they haven't explored. haven't seen the rest of china, ever since dad came to the us at 23 w only 100 in his backpocket. can you imagine seeing the other side of the world before you've explored your own backyard? 
	-- my dad had few vacation days, and i hated going back to china -- he always spent it on cool experiences for me, dubai, italy, spain, all the places western media paints ideally

they say your senese of time changes after you have children. well, what about how time changes for the children?

*Isn’t it ironic that, of all things, it’s our time machines that are stuck in the past?*

my mom writes upcoming lfie events on a big whiteboard, etching with black sharpie *"7/15 pick up angela.* 

on my calendar i time-block aspirations. goals. that *i will apply to this writing fellowship* or *by august i will be at X stage of my life* or maybe *on tuesday i will finally, finally drag myself to throw out the trash.*

whwat they don't tell you is a dinner table can be a time machine. a place of play. a stage, if you will if you situate yourself comfortably in the regal chairs you can filter through the multiple versions of annie who have sat in the same chair. sometimes as a king, the jewel of the family who's so precocious at such a young age.

mahogany is used for dining tables. and sometimes, coffins, as well. perhaps, a morgue. light brown striations streak down its length, like palm lines that dictate an entire life's history. 

back in shanghai during a visit in 5th grade, i emerged from the train to a rare beachy environment. during these trips i'm so used to urban smog, the view of the ocean was incongruos to me. it was one of my favorite memories - salty pacific ocean air splashing against my cheeks, 

some may use a dining table as a platter. as a kid, i used to throw the worst tantrums. among an arsenal of several manipulation techniques like slamming my head against the wall, one of my more morbid habits would be laying my plump arm against the cold, layering a mound of rice atop, and pretending to eat myself in protest. some self-immolation or a subverted version of 

i remember rushing through my food at the dinner table. picking at the tender slices of hong xiao ruo. hong shao ruo, or shanghainese braised pork belly, is a deceptively easy dish to make: simmered under low heat, time is the secret ingredient to drawing out the incredible umaminess. each piece of cupped pork glimmers like a jewel, with clear layers of bouncy skin protecting luscious fat and tiny slivers of meat. 


coaxed with my mother's love, shoveling rice down my throat in anticipation of something so much more important to get back to - my interrupted google chats or rotting calculus homework and the like.  food, cooked over time, is something i rarely see at my dining table. now a creature of convenience, i live and die by my air fryer - i subsist on a diet of charred pre-washed broccoli and freezer-burned salmon. there was a moment when i was my mothers prized piglet, satisfying layers of fat adorning a plump healthiness.

over text mom asks for pictures of my dinner, a bid for connection. 
i am not the only one who has been thinned. the helm of the kitchen, our fridge, once overflowing and plentiful, is not barren. 

i can see the bloodline thinning for them, when i look at the 

allow me to stop dancing around the kitchen and get it straight to you, 
there's this dangerous arithmetic i do, some sort of twisted inductive projection - when i'm 30 they'll be 70. when i'm 35 they will be 75. 
time dilation - time feels slowest at the beginnings and endings of our lives
at your youngest: with only few years accumulated, each year matters more
at your oldest: with only a few years left, you hold onto every minute
the truth is im terrified of outliving my parents.
every year is taking the math to its final end - when im 30 theyll be 68. when im 35 theyll be 73. 
it already aches when they walk, their bodies already frail. 
a child's experience of time upturns when they realize how old their parents are.

something about Chinese

"My mother used to collect orange blossoms in a small shallow bowl. I pass the tree each spring.  I always knew that grief was something I could smell. But I didn’t know that it’s not actually a noun but a verb. That it moves."
