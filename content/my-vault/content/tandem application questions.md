#### 1) Why are you interested in working at Tandem?

I'm no stranger to the complexities of navigating healthcare and insurance - as the child of immigrants, I saw first-hand their struggles interpreting dense insurance policies and healthcare claims at the dining table. I spent hours on the phone with doctors and pharmacies to translate medical jargon and ensure my parents received the care they needed. 
This led to a life-long interest in how we can make healthcare more accessible. It started with a high school science fair project where I prototyped an automatic pill dispenser, to my last summer internship, where I chose to dive into accelerating AI-drug discovery and the partnership opportunities with Microsoft. I'm convinced that the most impactful application of AI is within the life sciences, and Tandem's mission that "science should be the only limit to medicine" resonates deeply.
Beyond the mission, I'm drawn to Tandem's culture of relentless innovation. I'm seeking an environment where ambitious individuals challenge the status quo, take ownership of their work, and approach complex problems with unwavering determination. The opportunity to be part of a team that values documentation, communication, and the earnest pursuit of changing the world makes Tandem feel like the perfect intersection of my professional aspirations and personal mission. The Strategy & Ops role perfectly pulls from my experiencing wrangling with messy data, going up and down the levels of abstraction of a problem, and tackling ambiguity.  

Tandem's reputation for excellence precedes itself. but just as important as mission-alignment is culture-alignment - am i going to work at a place with the most ambitious people who dare to challenge the status quo and will be relentless in building the world they wish to see? will i be empowered to take ownership over my work and drive my workstreams to success? is there a strong culture of documentation and communication? will the team have the earnestness to tackle big problems requires a strong-willed team. tandem seems like the perfect place.

#### 1) In a brief paragraph, please share an example of an experience or accomplishment that reflects your alignment with one of Tandem’s values:

- **Commit to audacity.** "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't – you're right.”

Find the shortest path:

When our team needed to drive interest in our AI Assistant for genomics researchers at our company's biggest conference, traditional marketing channels were closed to us - they needed at least three-month heads-up before. This long path works well for more traditional long-term projects, but we were prototyping an end-to-end proof-of-concept where we wanted to engage with users in-person and validate their needs. So we took matters into our own hands. I created a sleek marketing video using Adobe Premiere Pro. The researchers on our team contacted their own academic friends to spread news by word of mouth. I surveyed HPC researchers within our network and incentivized them to come to the event. At the conference, I strategically networked, walking between partner company booths to pitch our concept, effectively creating our own marketing channel. Despite initially low expectations of only 20 signups, we ultimately packed the room, generating significant interest and securing multiple proof-of-concept requests. What's more, we got a recording of the event we could promulgate across our own networks. We learned we don't need to go down the traditional marketing process to drum up excitement for our product. 

Our sister teams had months of preparation to develop marketing videos, distribute marketing materials, and advertisements to draw people to their event. Marketing team scoffed when we asked for help for our exhibit - In order to get the resources, we would needed to have included our project within our semester roadmap months ago. 
We didn't want the lack of support to stop the success of our launch event at the conference. So we used our own abilities. At the conference hotel itself, I walked around booths of partner companies related to life sciences and pitched our idea. 
In the end, while only 20 people signed up for the event intially, we had a full house of attendees. What more, the event came with a link we could spread around the org, and I reached out to our business development team to share the link to their contacts. As a result, we received many requests for calls about PoCs, as well as valuable insight on how we should design the business model of our product. Long-term, we did infor marketing that we wnated support ahead of the next conference, but we knew that we had the skills to execute and accelerate.
