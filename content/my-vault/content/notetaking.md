if a complex idea is a fortress, each building block is an atomic note, or a smaller composable idea. 

my note-taking process is driven by the [evergreen note]([Evergreen notes turn ideas into objects that you can manipulate — Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/evergreen-notes)) philosophy. i capture transient thoughts in obsidian, stack them together into greater writing pieces when they resonate, and publish on substack.
