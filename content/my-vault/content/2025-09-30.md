script for phuong
know last time we chatted we agreed upon oct 14 as a start date but learned some things then after coming back from pto
1) microsoft can terminate my employment immediately and theres a fair chance they will 
2) there's also risk from the microsoft side of working at two companies at once. i udnerstand your team is ok with it and we have a partnership right now, but in case that sours i dont want to cuase a headache for anyones team isf someone legal 
	1) chatted w some employment lawyers were their recommendation was to not overlap given yk microsoft has their own ai team that i work with, and their own ai infra funcion 
3) want to stay thru the 15th for my vest date. its a sig number and while i could ask ur team to cover that difference if you rlly want me to join asap, i think it makes sense to join the week after

my proposal is that i will give my manager notice on the 16th 
and i join the following monday
or i can even join that friday 
this is coming out of a more logisitcal pov than workload
so im happy to onboard w kenny unofficially in any capacity the week of the 14th
