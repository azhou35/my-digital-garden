Really love talking to the team especially John, hes definitely someone I want to work under and learn from.
New York is a non negotiable. 

**What to Ask For:**

1. **Base salary**: $155k+ (above Etched to account for startup risk)
2. **Sign-on bonus**: $25-30k to offset your RSU loss
3. **Equity**: Be prepared to discuss but don't anchor low
4. **NYC confirmation**: Non-negotiable


"Hey I dont want to negotiate live on the phone. Scale is my top option. I love John, I want to work with John. But I want to make the best decision."
I need this on paper to work out with my family.
I know your teams been patient, I dont want to drag this out, but if you let me konw whats the best Scale can do,  I can get you an answer tommorow. 

Before we discuss compensation, I need to clarify location. NYC isn't just a preference for me - it's a requirement. Is there any possibility for me to work remotely from NYC, or does this role require being in SF?
If money were equal, I'd choose Scale immediately. That's exactly why I'm hoping we can get closer on compensation.
Scale is my preference, but I need the numbers to work.


On the compensation side, I'm walking away from $30k in vested RSUs at Microsoft, and I have a competing offer at $148.9k base plus $20k sign-on. Scale is still my preference, but I need the numbers to work for my family - with the competing offer what flexibility do you have on base and sign-on bonus to bridge that gap?

- Etched: $148.9k base + $20k sign-on + equity
- Microsoft RSUs forfeited: $30k
- Total first-year gap: ~$44k
- Your minimum acceptable sign-on: $35k (practice saying this number)
- microsoft - 154k 


you know i want to be fully transparent
scale is my top priority
super impressed by john linda allen and everyone the team
i really want to join
im aware johns based out of sf so that could be a discussion point for us 
i think we need to discuss nyc vs sf
esp given the start date would be soon i wouldnt be open to relocating to sf 

earlier we discussed for the role 
i dont think we're in agreement that this is a fair package for my scope of role
both based on market data and what i currently make and competing offer
and i want to work with u on how i can adjust my total package in value 


and im open to making this some part of base options 
but i want to make sure total package value is something im happy with
in terms of base 

my current employer just promoted me a a year ahead of most fokls 
and giving me an increase in rsus along with a new base salary of 154 900 

im leaving 30k on the table by leaving before august 
and this new promotion is bumping my existing comp package

i understand the scale of this startup and the diffeences w big tech 
but i also want to give u the most info
and i want to think of u as my future employer
and i dont want to by misleading

ive have a verbal offer from another startup, where we discussed comp pr early on
in my convo w the hardware startup they were willing to matching my microsoft comp
in terms of base of 154k and equity 
i was upfront at the beginning since they were series a so i was less sure
and in our convos 
im in the process of receiving a finalized offer

but i do want to be respectful to them to i dont want to go with that offer if scale package matches expectations

i dont have anything in paper
but ive had soft conversations 
im in the final stages and whats making me pause is i rlly enjoyed my convos with john 
and i rlyl respect john and what i can learn from 
and theyre comfortable matching what i make 
in order to get me to leave microsoft

at the end of the day to stack rank it i definitely align with the team and the opportunity at scale the most i just want to work together to make the numbers make sense


and if u have any doubts 
i just wanna make clear 
i i wanna have all the info before i decide properly

and i believe my references are worth this scope
and im hapyp to provid some references if thats whats gonna take 

its not just microsoft comp:
- no i completely understand 
	- my boyfriends a vc and i have the market data that the 50th percentile for pm ii for private companies is 160k
	- for private companies valued above >5 billion
