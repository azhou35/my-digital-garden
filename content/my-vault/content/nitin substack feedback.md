When I wake up around 8 AM with light leaking through the plastic amber blinds I panic and think I’m not equipped to love you. But nevertheless. Last weekend when we were up on the ridge and scrambling over jagged boulders was the only way forward I also thought _I can't do this_ but I could and I did. The mind plays tricks, undermines you. I can do things that seem physically overwhelming: it follows that I can do things that seem mentally overwhelming. Awareness of the self is often all that's in the way.

_“Writing a book is like moving into an imaginary house."_ Loving a person is like moving into a house you've only ever seen pictures of. Shocked by its live idiosyncrasies, you wonder if you can be happy there, if you can create balance out of the erotic and the domestic, the turbulence and the calm. I read a lot of books about how one might conceivably do this well. The answers are easy to decipher (_bids for attention, clear communication_) but hard to live.

I read that writing requires brutal honesty with yourself. I used to not be capable of that honesty but I'm getting better. Here's what I know: I'm afraid of commitment, terribly scared of being trapped. Despite this I continue to make commitments. I try to be truthful about the push and pull of it.

KEEP askingyourself why do you wanna write something
