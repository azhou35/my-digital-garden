title: "response to justin re writing community intentions"
---


i didn't give a satisfactory response for what i want out of this writing community 
why am i doing this?
* i still stand that writers are some of the most interesting people to talk to and are highly intentional 
	* there's a correlation between high quality people and people who write as a way of thinking / communicating their big ideas
* not everyone is an "interesting person" -- but some people have *interesting ways of looking at the world*
	* e.g. verci was disappointing bc while everyone was filtered to be *interesting*, idk if everyone had an *interesting pov*, at least not in the way i was inspired by. maybe its bc they were aloof but e.g. ppl who were f30u30 were so boring to talk to irl
* the nature of someone who writes / reads introspective work is that they're always analyzing and thinking about things beyond surface value 

i want to meet these kinds of people because:
* i simply get along with them as friends! contrasting the random people i meet at writing events vs work friends my age, the latter its so easy to get disillusioned by the shallowness of our convo. this is a cynical take but i genuinely think so many ppl i meet thru college networks are kinda boring to talk to, so i need some theme as a way to source a new network
* as a writer myself, im incentivized to meet a lot of people as a way to collect more data on human behavior and patterns and ideologies. (this bullet point heavily inspired by murakami's *novelist a vocation*, but i really do take note on everyone i meet bc it's inspiration for something i could write in the future). a lot of my writing is inspired by convos with other intentional/well-thought people!

i want an intentional way to meet people that i have conrol over?? 
as much of a technologist im an anthropologist

running writing club is like a recurring social experiment where we invite people who we think have intereting povs and see how everyone gets along
