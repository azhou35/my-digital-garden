 The title echoes the work of the scholar Anne Anlin Cheng, whose book “[The Melancholy of Race](https://www.amazon.com/Melancholy-Race-Psychoanalysis-Assimilation-American/dp/0195151623),” published in 2000, offers a theoretical framework for considering grief and mourning as defining vectors of the racial experience. One isn’t melancholy simply because of the experience of racism, Cheng suggests; melancholy, and its dynamics of loss and recovery, are the foundations for racial identity.

These terms descend, in part, from Freud, who described mourning as a conscious process in which we deal with the grief of losing someone or something we can identify. Melancholy, for Freud, involves a kind of grieving, too, only we are at pains to identify what we have lost. Our inability to comprehend the reason for our melancholia pushes us further into our subconscious depths, and manifests as a kind of permanent mourning. To Eng and Han, this phenomenon seemed akin to the “interminable sadness” of many of their students. Perhaps the dislocations of immigration and assimilation had something to do with their inability to identify what they had lost.

  

One of Han’s patients, a woman she calls Elaine, speaks of the pressure she puts on herself because of her parents, whom she believes would have been much “happier” had they remained in Korea. The sense of loss that her parents feel is “transferred onto and incorporated by Elaine for her to work out and to repair,” Han writes. Elaine’s life becomes a way of fulfilling, or justifying, her parents’ sacrifice—though she doesn’t consciously realize that she is seeking an impossible kind of comeuppance on their behalf.
