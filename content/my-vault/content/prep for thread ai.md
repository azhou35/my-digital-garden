### tell me about yourself
PM at Zing -> Product Lead -> startups in college -> Microsoft AI infra working on AI infra -> earliest proj on workflow orchestrators -> intro to background for gpu operational excellence

at cornell: data science, PM at ZIng, product lead of DTI - DTI is one of my favorite parts about cornell, felt so rewarding being able to work on a product i loved w ppl i admired. also worked on a startup in legal tech.
after grad i joined microsoft's ai infra team as a tpm-  because i saw we're at a time where hpc needs for high compute are converging w ai needs for huge amounts of data. 
right now im building solutions and roadmaps for the most high-value AI customers, like driving operational excellence for the GPUs we provide OpenAI, has given me valuable exposure to the limits of engineering at scale. 
actually my first project was investigating the gap in workflow orchestrators built for customers using our batch scheduling service, chatted with simulation customers on their needs. one of the key insights i saw is that engineers wanted to avoid cloud lock-in and that's why they preferred solutions outside of the hyperscalers.
this got me interested in the gaps we see in infra and i've been looking at startups in ai infra - i want to help shape solutions from the ground up, talk to new customers, prototype nad build for their use cases. 
looking around investments made by shardul at index i was specifically looking for those female-led, which is how i got to thread ai. 

would love to hear more 
### questions to ask
1. What attracted you to join Thread AI at such an early stage?
2. How has your role evolved since you started?
3. How do you approach ML infrastructure decisions, particularly around workflow orchestration?
4. How does Thread AI differentiate itself from the open source workflow managers? Astronomer
5. "How does product development work at Thread AI? Do you have dedicated product managers or is that handled differently?"
6. I saw you guys are tracking luxury, finance, etc - what other industries are you tracking?
7. - "Could you share how you're incorporating human oversight into your AI workflows? I'm especially curious about where you've found human judgment most critical."
8. How do you see the organization evolving over the next year in terms of team structure?"
9. *7. What skills or expertise do you feel your team is currently missing?
10. Are you hiring roles for product, stategy and ops, solutions engineering? Or even something liek forward-deployed engineering like palantir?*
11. I saw these roles were open but not sure if the engineering is strictly the best fit for me - i'm versed in coding but i like to think of myself as a PM who codes, or someone in strategy & ops which can help with gmessy data
CTA:
I noticed Thread AI has several open roles, and while I saw the engineering positions, I'm actually most excited about opportunities that blend technical knowledge with strategy. I consider myself a PM who codes—someone who understands the technical implementation details but thrives at the intersection of product, strategy, and operations. My background lets me navigate between technical and business contexts, particularly when dealing with complex data challenges that require both analytical thinking and strategic prioritization. I'm curious if Thread AI has roles that could leverage this hybrid skillset, especially as you're building infrastructure that needs to connect diverse systems and translate between different AI models and services
### role to pitch
interested in product, strategy & ops, solutions engineering, data 
- target verticals and chat with customers for their specific user needs and prototype solutions / proof of concepts
- drive partnerships 
- optimize performance metrics
- help with cost efficiency models
- - Build and scale new workflows and continuously identify and implement AI-powered efficiency gains in collaboration with engineers
    
- Explore, evaluate, and execute on new opportunities for the company, including strategic partnerships and new products and services
in a diff class
all the engineers were principal engineers 
using ai 
using models or creating new models
this is not reinventing the reel
allowing u use things
plumbing doesnt exist
get handed entire feature

engineering - do everything 
from product backend - tin bit

infra
every project growseveryone a ot 
put together demos
autnomy to choose 

how is it diff than self managed
using ai in a smart way
ai seems to be the most effective 
when u can integrate into existing systems
