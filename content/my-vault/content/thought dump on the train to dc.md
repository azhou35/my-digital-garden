* listening to music -- im so grateful for my headphones
* something about my appetite is fucked -- im not satisfied by food i need to snack for some reason 
	* is it the sweet tooth ? idk
* revisiting old songs 
* post khoi reflection:
	* yk sometimes its not sad looking back at stuff. maybe it played its last tune. 
* post sunny reflections:
* an notes: 
	* leave space for the people who make you happy 1000 % 

thought dump post 7/17 first meeting friends again
* i think my fav friends are the ppl i feel comfy showing this network diagram and them getting excited too. maybe this is a baseline level of shared intellectual curiosity i need to sustain friend attraction?
* AHH KATIEEEE it's always so good to talk to her
	* she suggested a temporal element to my network visualization
	* she is just SOOOO good. like omygod she talked about how she appreciated the last year bc of how it helped her get closer to her family and its clear she thinks about it in a different way than an american-minded one would
	* she has so much freaking empathy and is fantastic at asking questions 
	* lot of resonance with my old house
		* do you see a place or people? 
		* can you superimpose your new memories onto this old space? 
	* im expressing to a lot of ppl i want to 
* SAM 
	* her drawing a tattooo on me 
	* us staying up late and just making fun of ppl
	* lol i feel like katie is the lawful good and sam chaotic neutrla 
	* making art vs making content
	* YOU ARE LITERALLY WHERE YOU WANTED TO BE ALL THIS TIME AGO !! !
	* rlly interesting the wealth she comes from and how mommy she is 
* terra 
	* terra cooking me omelettes<3
	* def getting closer 
	* shes so funny and tbh so diff than the ppl i talk to 

at this age i still feel young. i dont feel liek i have any responsibilities. 


reflection on talking w sunny: lots of old friends im pretty different from now 
reflection post talking w justin: we are trying to assemble a squad but how do you speak one into existence? how similar / different can you be from someone? 
what is sustainable for sustaining your strong ties

interesting realizations:
* a lot of ppl i rlly respect are intentional with their time and voice their intentions online
