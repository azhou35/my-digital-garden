Consider what it means to make infrastructures more knowable–and not just something left to the experts and kept out of sight. To seek infrastructures yourself, notice their onramps and portals and handles in everyday places. Watch how people and organizations play their everyday contexts. Know that spatial scale, social proximities, tangible props, and traces of wear do still matter. Feel how form informs. This attitude can be fun to explore. For instance in Paris Invisible City﻿[1], Bruno Latour famously toured control rooms, tunnels, and switching stations. With Networks of New York﻿[2], Ingrid Burrington created a pocket field guide to the electronic data infrastructures at street level. This year, Gradient asks who else might join in this awareness–and where to start.
