### Kenny
- peter talks thru scheduling problems 
	- pending pods
- every engineeer says this is wwhat we faced
	- this is what we fixed along the way
- this is what is long tail
- -> is there anything we need to prioritize today 
- how often does this happen
	- data on this 
	- we need to work on this tooling
	- bc the next month we have this many maintenance ops
- create the urgency 
- here's whwat we accomplished
- heres the problems we ran into this
- to wrap everything up this is the long tail problem
- agree internally on what the biggest problems where
	- work w Evan Jane Jack

## Tito
- OFR bot 
	- Albatross 
		- Bot that 
		- can u comment on the tickets
- checked w calcium H200s/B200s 
- Andy - urgent topic 
- josh 
	- leaf switch reboots on h200s
	- they notice enoug nodes are down on a given switch 
	- then 3rd party puts on process 
	- and then 
	- prototype V1
		- we can agree on a threshold
		- 16/32 nodes - emergency on a threshold
		- 5 nodes on a given reboot 
	- 15 is a guarantee - hard go 
	- Tooling that we have for draining 
	- Could you have a test run with a bot 
		- ask the bots 
Asks:
Maint bot is working for Tito
- give ack to Tito 

Data Cleaning Exercise - Health checks
	-  Ran a test on HCAPortDown
	- Harden the health checks
	- AI: ask for 
	- What do we do when we have repeated tickets without logs
Are NVLink Switch failures 
- Our fixable action is requesting a reboot
- Require reboots
- Unplanned - which is why we file a 
- If its a non NVL related job on the nodes

Types of maintenances
- final sign off of classificaiotn
- incident -> reboot for NVL

Two big maintenances:
1. Austin - it's going to be all of Austin
	1. nitrogen 
	2. Monday Wed / 1 pod / 32 nodes a day 
	3. Could be up to 8 hours 
2. OVR3 - 2 days x 8 hr most of ORD3 
	1. c73 
	2. no flexibility of timing


### Azure 
- AMS25 
	- when we're doing the IB switch update 
	- if we're doing VM spins down our up 
	- system gets stuck
	- did this on HPC clusters w CPU cluster
- apply the shared clusters
- pick a day for switch update
- do the switch update

4 clusters
- now that we schedule early next week

tues - wed 

switch super early in the morning
early afternoon

Hey folks - we've heard the news about the upcoming Winer Storm Fern affecting the East Coast. Given that DC sites may be within the storm's path, are there any expectations or warnings you have received on the storm's impact to:
- DC operations 
- Loss of power 
- Impact to network 
Would love to get any heads up ahead of the cold weekend, thank you and stay safe!! 





As I joined Hardware Health as a new hire, Kenny guided me through my first cross-functional project addressing the overallocation problem in Zoku and enforcing the HWH SLA. He helped me identify the right partners to secure buy-in, define the ergonomics of an enforceable policy, and keep work on track with clear intermediate goals. He also pushed me to define outcomes and find opportunities to uplift partner teams’ work - for example, ensuring our approach supported Jos’s flex feature - so the project was directly useful to others. Throughout, he coached me on appropriate comms and making progress on an unpopular policy change while maintaining trust with RPMs or researchers.

All in all, he gave me the right tools and people to tackle an ambiguous problem, while granting me the trust and ownership to own the problem e2e. 

Right before the break, we received an urgent, high-stakes high-impact maintenance request. Kenny quickly scoped the severity, risks, and impact and clarified the plan of action for a project that required close collaboration with our CSP counterparts. He created a clear direction for how to execute the operation, as well as aligned with the right partner teams to get buy-in for the potential fallout. In his speed and organization he provided a clear example of how a TPM should quickly coordinate a plan with only partial information, and manage the inevitable risks. 

From this, Kenny broke down an intimidating, ambitious problem statement into a clear action plan that I could execute in early 2026, and ensured I had the right context and resources to drive a risky operation with minimal impact. 

I was appropriately set up with the right resources to drive a risky operation with minimal impact. 

He pushed to root-cause the required actions and translated ambiguity into a concrete execution plan and strategic approach. That created clear direction and set me up to execute effectively in early 2026.



1. I really appreciate seeing the strategy of the Fleet team and TPM. Especially as our TPM team gets slightly larger, I invite any and all opportunities to collaborate with each other and ensure our projects are provide net-positive value. (For example, working with Simon on the 2026 Azure maintenances provided me better insight to the risks/incentives/systems he operates on a daily basis). I welcome more touchpoints with the other TPMs where we can find the synergies between our work - esp as our individual scopes impact each other - e.g. me/Yacoub on HWH involvement in turnups, me/Simon on maintenance/scheduling.
2. As the very nature of a "TPM" changes, and being someone earlier in their career, I'd love to learn more about 1) from first-principles what makes a good TPM in executing operations, managing risks, driving automations 2) and what is the future-state TPM that is able to tackle on a problem space that is going to 3x with our compute in the next quarter. This could entail more demos amongst us on our personal productivity stack (eg would love to learn more from Simon on his automations), more stories/personal learnings from our projs (e.g. retros on navigating X Y Z), more opportunities for mentorship-style convos.
