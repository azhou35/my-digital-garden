title: "bull bear case for sierra"
---

bull case:
- i love the job, i love the people, i stay in ny 
- me & nitins relationship survives
- sierra grows a lot and i transition into an agent pm 
- i ultimately get to a decent role here 
- they match the comp that oai gives me

bear case
- i am always wondering what life in sf would be like
- the job is still general tpm work but its for customer service which i cant sya i love 
- i wonder if i passed up openai 
- it doesnt open doors for me the way that oai does
- i made this decision because of nitin and i resent him for it 
- they dont match the comp that oai gives me 
- i still feel like i could have done better
- i pass up on my chance to join a generational company
