**infrastructure inefficiency**, **hardware failures**, or **compliance constraints**:
* Site Reliability Engineer, hardware systems engineer, capacity planning manager
* Questions like:
	* “What’s the most common cause of unplanned GPU downtime in our clusters?” “Do you track hardware telemetry (e.g., thermals, power) to predict failures, or is it mostly reactive?” “How much time does your team spend troubleshooting silent hardware errors (e.g., CUDA memory faults)?” “If you could magically solve one infrastructure headache, what would it be?”
* Hardware engineers
	* “What telemetry gaps exist today for monitoring GPU health (e.g., voltage droop, fan RPMs)?” “Are there thermal/power inefficiencies in our clusters that software could mitigate?” “How do we handle multi-tenant data isolation when collecting metrics from shared nodes?”
* Capacity Planning: 
	* “How much overprovisioning do we do to hedge against downtime? Is this a big cost driver?” “What’s the ROI threshold for adopting a tool that reduces GPU waste by 20%?”
