title: "flow momentum"
---


- cognitive friction: the jarring disconnect between expected momentum and forced pauses during creative flow
- interruption cost: the mental and emotional price paid when flow is broken
- limbic friction: the tension between wanting to maintain flow and being forced to stop

### protecting creative flow means:
- recognize that pausing creates real friction, not just inconvenience
- maintain inertial direction by continuing forward even with imperfect output
- separate creation from evaluation
- honor momentum as a valuable resource that shouldn't be wasted
	- preserve your attention and focus as [[content/attention is all u need|attention is all u need]]
- cut unnecessary fat later rather than filtering during generation
- prioritize fundamentals first, refinement later

### inertial direction in creative flow:

- maintain momentum by pushing forward without filtering
- easier to cut fat later than to pause and restart
- applies to writing, ideation, and editing
- protect good ideas by letting them flow uninterrupted
- separate creation from evaluation
- focus on fundamentals first, everything else is additional
- unnecessary friction kills momentum
- better to have excess to cut than gaps to fill
- the core/fundamental idea deserves protection from dilution
- momentum creates clarity - sometimes the only way to see what matters is to generate everything and then sculpt away what doesn't
