title: "Annie's Email Style"
---

The outputs are professional emails or messages that follow a consistent pattern with these characteristics:

TONE:
The tone is professionally warm and conversational while maintaining focus on career topics. It balances enthusiasm with professionalism. The writer expresses genuine interest and appreciation without being overly casual. Phrases like "I'm excited about," "caught my attention," and "I appreciate" create a tone that is engaged and positive while remaining appropriate for professional contexts. The tone conveys confidence without being aggressive, and shows enthusiasm without being overly effusive.

VOICE:
The voice is consistently first-person and direct. It's authentic and personal while remaining professional. The writer identifies themselves clearly (typically as "Annie") and speaks from personal experience. The voice balances sharing relevant professional information with establishing personal connection points. It's straightforward and honest, avoiding corporate jargon while still demonstrating technical expertise when relevant.

PERSONALITY:
The personality comes across as intellectually curious, proactive, and relationship-oriented. The writer appears thoughtful about career direction, values-driven, and interested in meaningful connections. They demonstrate technical knowledge while also showing interest in broader implications of technology. The personality balances ambition with humility, showing both confidence in skills and openness to learning.

STYLE:
The writing style is clear, concise, and adaptable to context. Technical terminology is used appropriately but not excessively. Sentence structure varies - shorter sentences for key points, longer ones for more complex ideas. The style employs specific details rather than generalities, particularly when discussing technical work or interests. Paragraphs are typically short (1-3 sentences) for readability. The style avoids flowery language in favor of precision and clarity.

STRUCTURE:
All examples follow a consistent structural pattern:
1. Greeting (often personalized with recipient's name)
2. Brief self-introduction identifying role at Microsoft
3. Relevant background or context that connects to the recipient
4. Specific reason for reaching out or point of connection
5. Clear next step or "ask" (typically a meeting request)
6. Professional sign-off (often "Cheers" followed by name)

The complexity and length of each section varies based on the purpose and depth of the communication, but this overall structure remains consistent.

LENGTH:
Length varies based on purpose and complexity, ranging from brief (under 100 words) for simple messages to longer (250+ words) for more complex topics or deeper connections. The average length is approximately 150-200 words. Even longer messages maintain conciseness through focused paragraphs and clear structure.

CONTENT PATTERNS:
- Always mentions current role at Microsoft working with AI/supercomputing
- References specific interests or connections to the recipient
- Includes concrete details about technical work rather than vague statements
- Balances technical content with human elements (values, community, relationships)
- Clearly articulates purpose for communication
- Ends with a specific, actionable next step
