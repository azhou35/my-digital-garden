high experience at concert last night 

concerts vs raves
- raves we value novelty over familarity
	- we enjoy producers who create generative noises at concerts
	- enjoy producers less for their songs and more for their style 
	- maximum dopamine is when they remix an old classic that you enjoy 
		- familiarity + novelty
		- 
- concerts we value familiarity over novelty
	- very hard to "discover" new artists that you enjoy at a festival without recognizing any songs
	- very had to listen to artists you listen to passively but dont know their entire discography

3rd pov vs 1 pov
- at concerts i realized im vey sensitive to 3rd pov observation
- but less self aware of myself and ohw im currecntly perceved 
	- hence why i bump into things easily 
	- or prob have things astry in my clothes i dont notice

nitin's ability to think and form arguments to shape ppls actions 
- i realized hes able to plan things out 3 steps ahead of time 
- incepts the idea of going to an artist into another persons mind
