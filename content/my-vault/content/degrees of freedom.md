[[content/free will vs duty|free will vs duty]]
to be truly free is to live with constraints


we are told to be the architects of our lives. draw the blueprint, optimize the layout, and build higher and higher.

we're promised this dream, that with enough elbow grease and toil your life can stand hundreds of stories high. social media amplifies this promise: you can start a business from your bedroom, pivot careers with a bootcamp, reinvent yourself with the right viral tweet. 

but if an artist is given a blank canvas, they may freeze. 

i find myself blinking at a blank blueprint, overwhelmed by the paralysis of infinite choice - drifting between career ideas, identities, philosophies. in boundless choice i struggle to find a reason to act. 

the result? a crisis of meaning. the act of choice itself becomes unbearable when our feeds flood us with endless life paths under the premise that *you could do anything.* 

but how did we end up at this cognitive buffet? maybe the problem is that we lack structure. purpose. constraint. technology promised liberation from everything that once limited us. we're no longer bound by geography, gatekeepers, or the paths our parents walked. 

as a result, we drown in our freedom. 

### i. technology accelerates agency

for most of human history, your life was predetermined. follow your family's trade, worship your culture's faith. technology promised something different: the tools for humans to *shape their fate*.  each innovation was a small triumph to overcome circumstance: we coaxed fire to tame the night, constructed telephone lines to close distances, even sequenced genes to manipulate innate features.

it's no wonder a god complex comes so easily - we have found a way to seize your fate and steer it to your beckoning. previous generations found meaning in battles chosen for them - wars, survival, caste systems. *men used to go to war* and now we pick our own fights: climate crisis, population decline, healthcare reform. we reinvent outdated systems, disrupt entire industries, build the future from anew.

yet, while culture celebrates individual-driven action, there's often insufficient reflection on _what_ we're building and _why_. along the way our individualism has further disconnected us from society and befuddled our shared meaning. why toil over skyscrapers that no one will use? why disrupt the environment to generate endless videos without soul? 

this leads to a kind of purposeless productivity - maniacally building without examining what world we're actually building toward . [22. Nadia Asparouhova - Ideas That Infect - Jackson Dahl](https://jacksondahl.com/dialectic/nadia-asparouhova#[00%2024%2001]%20Legibility%20and%20Illegibility%20as%20a%20Tactic) 
when everyone becomes their own free agent, optimizing their individual path, we lose the shared projects that once brought communities together. 

our tools for freedom have become our own prison. free time is a misnomer - time is the only currency that's never re-printable, yet we treat our hours as limitless. we dawdle and dally, mercenaries who float from side quest to side quest without any unified cause.

what is the point of radical freedom if it leads to a meaningless life?  the absence of limits may not be liberation at all.

### ii. the role of constraints 

duty, which once defined traditional society, is viewed as a constraint. but perhaps we've misunderstood the fundamental relationship between freedom and limitation. 

responsibility is a necessary simplification mechanism to reduce the overwhelming complexity of possible lives. in theory i could choose to live anywhere in the world, even disappear into europe for some time - but the very real constraint is the filial piety i feel towards my parents in jersey. i could picture myself quitting my job in favor of some artistic pursuit - but i cannot do so without considering some future family of mine, and how to provide them with the best life as my parents have done for me. 

i don't see these as limitations, but rather, anchors and pivot points that give my choices meaning. think of degrees of freedom: independent variables that define how a system can move. consider a tetherball - it swings freely in any direction but only because it's tethered to a central point. remove that anchor and the ball falls. 

the constraint doesn't limit freedom - it enables a different kind of movement entirely.   

hegel understood this paradox centuries ago: real freedom isn't the absence of constraints, but choosing to align with something larger than yourself. it's not just about making choices, but articulating the reasons behind the choices and understanding how they align with a universal purpose. 

without real-life constraints, an optimization algorithm can run astray. by following metrics one would optimize for profits and sell off metadata, drive towards engagement and farm for likes with clickbait. technology without ethical boundaries becomes technology without soul—lacking the human capacity for self-reflection and moral reasoning. [[Project Vend: Can Claude run a small shop? (And why does that matter?) \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1)]

this brings us to a critical reframing: do we wish to be the architect of our life? ruthlessly obsessed with every contour of our future house, concrete straight lines dictating a blueprint? 

or rather, the gardener. who patiently tends to their field, giving shape by way of natural forces. the gardener understands natural forces, while the architect imposes through force of will. technology has made us all architects of our own lives, but perhaps we need more gardener-like wisdom.

the gardener understands that boundaries like soil type, climate, and seasons don't limit growth - but rather, guide it towards sustainability.

*"i do not control the wind, i study it."*
### iii. a way forward

in magnifying one aspect of human nature - the desire for control - we've neglected fundamentals - the need for belonging.

the solution isn't to abandon our agency or revert to feudal constraints, but consciously choose our limitations. *to try to understand the world, to imagine something different, and to build something that fulfills that vision.* how can we make things with care and intention, and how can the things we make us more caring and intentional?

there is a fruit tree in my home backyard that yields the prized asian pear. i've watched my mom tend to her over the seasons, carefully, lovingly. 

i don't understand the time she spends cultivating this tree, when we can get pears so easily in the supermarket, when i can literally order delivery to my home. i never quite understood how my parents chose the constraint of the suburbs, bound to car-based transport over the freedom of the city.

but within those chosen boundaries they forged something meaningful. a life oriented around their children, shared conversations around the dinner table. weekends spent at the farmers market and picking pears. 

i want to choose my constraints. live near my friends who i love. cook with the vegetables in season. follow where this red string leads me, anchored by the beating of a fickle heart.

if an artist is given a blank canvas, they may freeze. but given four colors, you compel prioritization and clarity. 

sometimes the fate or our circumstances gives us a color palette to work with. this structure is what makes freedom meaningful.

towards a new future i'm a big fan of general manifestos about techno-society - see [Letters to a Young Technologist](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/) , [⚡️ Take Back the Future! - by Jasmine Sun - Reboot](https://joinreboot.org/p/manifesto),  [The Philosopher-Builder - Cosmos Institute](https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/the-philosopher-builder). 

the next step is not to revert back to feudal times, nor abandon our highly autonomous modes of actions - but rather land somewhere in the middle. to understand not only what we build but articulate why we build. i'm a fan of 
do not abandon your agency, but take control of it. 

*to try to understand the world, to imagine something different, and to build something that fulfills that vision* and enable our humanity; to invest in investigating our own moral framework - how can we make things with care and intention, and how can the things we make us more caring and intentional? 

generally, i'm curious about how constraints come into play to creation here. 

- new curation architecture - where before elders/priests/respected ppl in society filtered our possibilities, how do we embed this into our algorithmic discovery? 
- how do we intentionally narrow our possibilities, use technology to guide us to alignment with our internal compass
- what chosen constraints do we add back into our life?
