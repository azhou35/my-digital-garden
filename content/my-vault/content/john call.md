- **Data:**
    
    - Includes GenAI (the most impacted by the Meta deal).
        
    - Includes traditional autonomous vehicle data labeling (evolving into robotics).
        
    
    **Applications:**
    
    - Composed of Public Sector (U.S. gov), International Gov, and Enterprise.
        
    - Growing focus on “agentic AI” for real-world deployment (Palantir-esque model).
- The company is shifting focus **from GenAI to Public Sector/Enterprise applications**.
    
- There’s **execution risk** around whether this pivot will succeed.

**6. Bear vs Bull Case**

- **Bear Case**: Loss of top talent, GenAI collapse, Meta becomes the only major customer, and pivot fails—leading to plateau or wind-down.
    
- **Bull Case**: Talent stays, customers are retained, public sector and robotics grow, and Scale eventually IPOs in ~5 years.
