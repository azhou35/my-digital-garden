we're all running away from something but we all need something to care aobut
does it get lonely in new york? 
strangers habit 
adult loneliness phenomenom 

when you move around -- your relationship with someone changes

if you dont push yourself to do something and meet people your world can get pretty small 
sobering 
even college is cyclical ( almost a more predictable structure )
larger life thing where nothing and nobody is permanent

so susceptible to the weather
