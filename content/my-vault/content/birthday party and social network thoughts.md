title: "birthday party and social network thoughts"
---

themes:
* information flow: how does information disseminate through my social graph? 
* degrees of closeness: how close are my friends really to me or each other? how many answers they know right off the bat as a proxy for closer
* anchors in parties: how are conversations anchors, activites, food, etc? 
# Context Collapse and Social Information 
Promulgation

## Context Collapse at House Parties
I've been thinking about what you said regarding house parties and my intentions for my birthday event. The idea of having all my friends in one space creates this context collapse - where different dimensions of my life intersect. Rather than seeing this as confusing, I'm interested in how these different sides of myself (my writer friends, photography friends, runner friends) can interact and see these hypered dimensions of existence that they themselves don't normally see.

## Social Anchor Points in Party Conversations
People struggle with context collapse in party conversations - they need anchor points to hold onto:
- Commentary on shared experiences ("how's this food?")
- Connection mapping ("how do you know the host?")
- Group identification ("who else do you know here?")

## Information Promulgation Experiment
Caroline's fun facts cards inspired me, but the execution got derailed by food priorities and static social clustering. I want to create something that focuses on information promulgation across social nodes.

## Bingo Card as Network Analysis Tool
The concept is a bingo card filled with hidden internal lore - specific trivia that maps to different ventures of myself. For example, "what class did [I] get into?" would only be known by my internal programming class circle. 

### Information Flow Mechanics
The ideal user experience maps to network theory:
1. Participants encounter information nodes (card questions)
2. They seek out different network clusters for answers
3. Social lubricant (alcohol) increases network connectivity
4. The objective is to study information promulgation across different nodes
5. Document how knowledge propagates through the social graph

## Graph Network Theory Application
My research into graph networks and connection analysis directly applies here. We can model:
- Nodes (individual friends)
- Edges (their interactions)
- Information flow patterns
Unlike language models which flatten multi-dimensional relationships into 2D structures, social networks maintain their dimensional complexity.

## Information Promulgation Documentation
I want to track:
- Inter-node information flow
- Cross-cluster knowledge transfer
- Documentation of interaction patterns
- Source attribution in information chains
- Create a reflection piece on network dynamics

## Systems Theory Integration
This connects to "Thinking in Systems" - focusing on:
- Information flow mechanics between system parts
- Hydraulic analogies (like water through pipes)
- Hierarchical information structures
- Network dynamics in social systems

The hierarchical structure of information promulgation is fascinating - especially seeing how we can apply graph theory and systems thinking to model social interaction patterns in real-time.
