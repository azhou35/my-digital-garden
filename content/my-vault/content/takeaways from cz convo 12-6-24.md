title: "takeaways from cz convo 12-6-24"
---

self-truths i am confident about:
* i am deep friends with ppl who are plugged in that i know will actively help should i choose to recruit 
* i am acquaintances/friends w ppl she mentions - haize labs, etc 
* i have hobbies and driven by creative aspirations as much as career
	* she did mention why dont u start a design agency - i could always just do my own thing - start my own product consultancy design thing??
* i am working on a cooler part of azure than she is 
things ppl around me are doing that i know i dont wanna do :
* making tik toks and becoming microinfluencers - not true to myself. i want to make art not content
* happy to stay at work for 2-3 years - not true to myself. i want to speed run things to where i feel most happy
we talked way more than i thought i did but also i let myself loose w what i talked about
sidebar: stalked all the ppl who got instacart apm and none had a better bg than me - honestly speaking, i wish i j interviewed earlier

my pain is that i dont think there's any fellow girl whos just as ambitious and creative and well-spoken as me is someone i can become close to - i truly think i value being an empathetic good person more than they do 

we need certain feedback loops the revise the north star - eg novak & rafa/rog 

things that put me off
* the way she knew LL's comp right off the bat
* she name dropped Rak Garg from BCV and i was like wut
* i mentioned mark and she immediately looked him up and was like how do i meet him
* the way she keeps calling evan justin
* the way she brought up how shes going to be andreesen scout and fixated on takng the test and being stressed about it but is SUPer hand wavey on how she got into it
	* she is a scout atm and super handwavey about that too
* i always ask her about contray and she is handwavey about that too
there is a part of me driven by spite

* inherent rivalry arises when creative ppl encounter each other daily 
* much easier to find ur nemesis in nyc
	* ur nemesis is not ur enemy - its ur dark twin - ur foil - the gaze at ur nemesis is lookin at ur mirror
* examples: picasso and matisse, edison and tesla, jobs and gates, johnson and larry bid
* nadal and ferdere 
[Invisible Duels - by Anu Atluru - Working Theorys](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/invisible-duels)
* invisible duel is a battle within urself masked as a silent battle w someone else where their progress becomes a silent threat to ur own 
* defined by:
	* proximity w/o friends, parallel process, signals of success
		* cat - deep proximity to each other but i cannot trust her and do not feel safe around her 
	* dirty fuel
* we're competing for *our own self worth and unique narrative identity*
* nietzsche's ressentiment - envy -> self loathing, making us reactive to others' values instead of our own 
	* trap: instead of "what do i want" its "why dont i have what they do"
		* example, cat being like oh u should go into crypto - i have NO desire to do this
* girard's mimetic desire explains that others chase bc pursuits make it seem valuable
* sartre's le regard - being seen by others shapes our actions, reducing us to objects in their gaze
	* GAZE - 
* invisible duels diagnose u - any emotions they povoke are signals that reveal something unspoken about what we truly want but haven't pursued w clarity or confidence 
* ur not grounded in ur own values and goal s
* how to solve it ? make them neutral
	* be so absorbed in something thats ur own private sphere - healthy obsession = focused joy
