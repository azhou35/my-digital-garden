summertime tik tok:

Every day is just a day - until it's the last

 "we learn timing through fruit. pick it too soon and find bitterness, pursue it too late and it collapses in your hands. friendship and love aren't so different.
  "some of us are raspberries, tender and exposed. so delicate they still need to be hand-harvested, where bruising comes easily and stain at the touch."
 "we feel connected when someone sees us fully, beyond the shells we hide behind."
"there is no endless summer. friends stay for a season or a reason"
