[[]()]()reallly great day with nitin
last day before openai 1st day 
started off in the morning in governors island qc spa 
went thru all the saunas, steam rooms, there was this minty room?? 
open toed shoes kind of hurt
peppermint - infused steam with tibetan folk music and flute in the background

nitin: ur not alone and remember how incredibly proud and what an achievement this is

semma: sooo good
- lobster w moilee was life changing 
- succulent meat almost as good as le coucou

october: the beginning and ending of things
isn't it absurd/surreal that i get the thing ive been desiring all these months and it almost hasn't registered

goals for openai: 
- formulate a stance on agi and what is feasible and possible
- develop confidence for my decision making skills
- push myself to the limits and devote myself to work for at least a year - see where i come out of it 


weaknesses to work on:
- my attention to detail / sensitivity to messing up at work
