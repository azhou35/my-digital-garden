**gallery reflections**

review:
* ~70 ppl signed up, 50 ppl showed up, 4 waves
future events:
* photo walks - sometime before end of july 
* photo workshops
* photo mixers

* future galleries 
* * how do you involve non photographers into this? hobbyist photographers?

what could have gone better:
- premounting the boards was time 
- printing the text to be larger 
- using a paper cutter


### factor fellowship interview

about me: 
- studied data sci in college
- took time off to build a legal tech startup to automate contract redlining
- joined microsoft right when their deal with openai was heating up
	- came in the right time - even tho i was early in career, the way 
- as a technical PM working on supercomputing
	- so i work w customers like OpenAi to orchestrate large-scale GPU infrastructure, design ML observability tools, and prototype AI workflows across research domains like genomics
- Across roles, I’ve been drawn to **making complex systems more visible**. 
- I’m here because I’m looking for the right context—people and spaces--
- support a suite of hpc on cloud products 
	- those to accelerate batch inference 
- * Built 0->1 copilots to help customers set up their batch schedulers 

why startups 
why now

career interests now:
* at a company like microsoft, you make huge monetary investments at scale where it limits innovation 
	* if it isnt broke dont fix it
* honing my technical skills across data science, prototyping, etc
* as well as searching for places to plug into startup ecosystem 
	* writing for contrary research on data observability startups
	* actually chatted with tom seo about this, since i originally worked w him all the wa back in cornell at cornell vc
	* 
* The past few years I've been working at AI infrastructure and hyperscalers and become far too attuned to the cumbersome nature of scaling AI workloads. I would hop on calls with research customers and find and developers were spending more time fighting with infrastructure than actually doing their cool AI work.- 

framework for next role:
* high - growth, lots of changing patterns where someone who thrives as a high leverage generalist can come in and find the points 
* talent dense 
* domain fit - generally enjoy tools that make it easier for someone to do something 

why factor?
* for the startup curious there's a lot you can do on your own interms of meeting folks at interesting companies 
	* building your skills
	* refining ur pitch
* but it's helpful beyond measure to have a mentor steer you in the right direction
* a lot of my mentors are very 
* it truly appeals ot me how nyc - forward it is 
* its process over outcomes 
* training and mentorship from invsetors and founders
* cohort of similar operators
* not only transition into a role that's the right fit 
	* but develop and iterate the mental frameworks on how to be a betterbulilder

types of companies: 
- series b - d 
- two divisions of company
	- deep ai infra - like a inference platform/compute management like fal.ai / baseten / modal labs
	- ai verticals - ones where its crucial to develop trust with the customers to deploy applied ai solutions, like healthcare/fintech 
		- moment for wealth management
		- healthcare - ambience healthcare, camber/tandem 
	- here's the set of problems i cant stop thinking about
		- How do we build systems that are more observable to humans

types of role:
* though rn im a technical pm, im agnostic to actual role title
* if i decompose it i enjoy moving between nontech and technical audiences, where i can talk to subject matter experts, prototype ideas, 
	* involve **synthesizing messy inputs**—whether from users, technical constraints, or market dynamics—and shaping them into **actionable product direction** or **early prototypes**. This could look like a role on a **founding product team**, as a **technical product strategist**, or even as a **design researcher** working on AI/infra tools
types of questions:
1. what sort of arcs do you see fellows go thru?
2. how structured is the fellowship? 
3. how is the program designed for collaboations emerging organically among fellows? 
4. canu walk me thru some speicifc outcomes someoneone has had thru the program? 
5. what draws u towards the

What do you plan on exploring at Rabbitholeathon?

*

This rabbitholeathon will be a themed rabbitholeathon centered around Disruption. We encourage you to take a look at our blog post for the inspiration behind the theme and some ideas to get you started

  

This is not set in stone, we are just curious what you'd potentially like to spend a weekend exploring!

Share some things you've made!


Show us some things about yourself or things you've worked on/are proud of and why it's meaningful to you (personal website, projects, writing, art, music, journal entries, early drafts of something you're working on, etc.).

### jessica 
- chatted w john
- came away with a rlly good framework on how to think about this decision
- ultimately going to choose to not join scale at this time which si rlly disappointing since i was so excited by your team and all the work youve poured into me in this process
	- main thing is product focus has changed
	- At the end of the day, since john is moving away from gen ai to defense, there was no longer an alignment in the type of domain id be working on
	- i still think theres a lot to learn and do at scale 
	- but its ultmately not aligned w my career goals to build domain exp in defense 
	- theres transparently a lot of uncertainty i have about the company 
	- and for that i dnt think this is the right time to join
- i want to emphasize this is not about the process 

impatience vs bias for action




this is a power outage
- we just want to work with oai on timing and date
- go ahead and do the dates
	- create the incident
	- track the incident 
	- when ur done 
	- hey we wanna deallocate from prod at this point
	- - **Firmware Update Schedule:** Provide the schedule for firmware updates required for the Phoenix 11 and 27 clusters. (Annie)
	- frm this hour oai will deallocate 
- ask how many nodes can u handle at a time 
	- do you deallocate one cluster a ta time
	- two 
	- we need to come up with a plan 
	- oai is out this week
	- get a schedule july 8th 
	- share cx7
	- if theyre gonna be deallocated to 11/27/61 
	- having schie team do all the repairs
	- when theyre done 
	- lets evaluate whats on the nodes 
	- when we do the repairs what will be ont he node 
	- can nvidia places the latest 

hey guys can u guys have followed up on this two action 
is crd going to be installed already on the nodes when they come back
host os + cx7 we still need to do that

end of this week for sat13 for sat13
by 7th - saagar says ok 
get to a pretty draft for remediation for h100 
sense of we're the team is at
hey do we need another team to start on 

- bump sunita july 14th
- bump tony and darmesh 
- proacticely host os 
- illhca 
- cant do it all at once 
- doing it little by little

dealloc = deleting VMs
in the fabric we can see if there are any containers in the cluster
testing in production = allows a node to have sometihng in sesesion
bc its not in production 
we were not formally released
not too strict on 
critical
if they interrupt a big job
wanna know r u returning the same capacity as before the maintenance

after maintenance, check that NIS is at least 95% of what it was before maintenance

technically maintenance is done when 95% of nodes is returned

if majority is 
if ur trying to recover nodes 
theyre in not ready available 

XTS 
talk to meghan/mackie 

Having 45 min to validate may not be best use of time 
if we can come to agreement with oai with cluster sooner not validated and not sooner 
put the validation in anad see how they react
if they prompt - make sure u can defend
