**Tell me about yourself.**

I grew up in New Jersey in the shadow of Bell Labs, which instilled in me both a technical mindset and an entrepreneurial spirit from an early age. Attending an engineering high school, I developed strong technical foundations, but I also had a deep love for humanities—this combination sparked my passion for bridging technical complexity with human-centered solutions.

This interest led me to Cornell, where I studied data science while also leading our product development club. I took a lot of machine learning classes and loved the complexity and messiness of data. 

After graduation, I joined Microsoft as a Technical Product Manager on the AI infrastructure team—timing that proved fortuitous with Microsoft's deepening partnership with OpenAI. My role focuses on how supercomputing at scale works for OpenAI and Microsoft AI, managing the operational complexity of running these incredibly expensive machines efficiently.

At Microsoft, I've worn multiple hats across strategy, operations, data analysis, and customer engagement. I work closely with the engineering team for Azure Batch, which is our scheduling service for AI/ML workloads. I've become the data guru on our team, developing analytics dashboards that track usage metrics and provide critical insights for both internal teams and OpenAI.

One of my proudest achievements has been improving the operational SLA for OpenAI's clusters from 90% to 95%—representing millions in compute value and directly impacting cutting-edge AI research capabilities.

Where I am today is looking to build on this foundational experience in a faster-moving environment. I learn best when pushed to my limits, and I'm seeking a place with rapid product lifecycles where I can make a more direct impact. My current role has become more operations-heavy than I initially expected, and while I've excelled at it, I want to return to what brought me to tech in the first place—building products that make complex processes easier for people.

Scale's position at the intersection of AI infrastructure, data quality, and model performance represents exactly the kind of challenge I'm looking for—a place where my technical background and product sensibilities can contribute to solving some of the most interesting problems in AI today.
