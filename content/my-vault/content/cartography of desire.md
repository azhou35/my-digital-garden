[]()[collective memory]
- how can we use maps to represent things about how we experience a city?
	- first dates w ppl
	- times you've cried with people 
	- where's the last time you saw a person
* how can the paths we trace around the city reveal our inner desires & avoidances?
* how can we transform a city from a physical space into an emotional archive - reflect the memories, connections, and human experience
general pov: i love using open source data to create a collective art project
& urban design pefectly faclitates how we perceive & experience a city
- print out a map of nyc and have people map out thing 
general idea of using boring primitives (maps,email,gcal) as means of communication/art

### Nitin Anniversary Map

* wayla
	* the first time we met was after a week of 90+ degree days in the city. i had claimed the wave was too intense for me to leave the apartment, and delayed any meetup day-after-day. in truth, i was deeply anxious.
	* in a aggressively yuppie thai restaurant i confessed to you my closest friends were moving away from me.
* wililamsburg
	* it was on a picnic bench by the dumbo ferry where i felt time suspend mid-air, like bugs in amber. (if only the summertime mosquitos stopped moving, too.) a 3 am conversation carries infinite energy - hushed childhood stories shared like secrets.
* flushing, queens night market
	* it was the first moment i knew i could spend unlimited hours talking and we wouldn't stop.
* brooklyn navy yard
	* we saw peggy guo and so desperately wanted to say "i love you"
* tompkins park
	* the path of 9th street is paved with anticipation of te noir and stale ac. it's where we faced many many problems with your ac, we spent mornings walking in the beautiful light, and we ate our way around the local restaurants.
