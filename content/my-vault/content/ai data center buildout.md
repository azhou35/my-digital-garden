“if it is not a law of nature, it is a shared belief”
If we look at the physical collocation data center market, the market has doubled in just 4 years with vacancy at just 3%. Occupancy has increased by 30% since 2020, construction has jumped 7x in 2 years, project pre-leasing rates are at 84% and data center asking rents have increased by 13%-37% (source: JPM

shared believes =/= natural laws 
- current ai infra:
	- scale is massive - 61% of microsofts free cash flow is into CapEX and R&D in 2024
- downward pressure on revenue:
	- AI is becoming comomtiditized (cheaper hardware)
- upward pressure:
	- future ai apps need more compute, enterprise adoptoin
- for ai to reach its full enterprise potential it needs 
	- inference-time reasoning
		- which requires reliability/accuracy, privacy/security, organizational readiness
- prediction
	- oversupply of ai infra before demand catches up

hyperscalers need to generate at least $400 - 50 0 billion in additional revenue to earn 50% gross margin on ~$250 bn of annual data center spending


Specifically, inference-time reasoning will be required for LLMs to reach full potential in enterprise deployments.

value will accrue to app layer companies leveraging ai for specific use cases
