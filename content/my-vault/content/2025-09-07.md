ifferent ways voice AI companies are quantifying the inscrutable. 

  

I'm currently at a juncture where I want to be more intentional on where I take my career  — having previously spearheaded a curriculum on ethical applications of AI for [AI4ALL](https://ai-4-all.org/) and researched HCI, I want to revisit some of my previous questions about ethical applications of AI in industry. Hume AI definitely stands out with its intentional approach to emotional intelligence and its nonprofit effort to define best practices for AI progress.

At Microsoft I honed my product experience building an AI infra platform for developers, where I rapidly prototyped copilot agents to drive user adoption and examined usage data with SQL to guide our strategic efforts. In my free time, been writing about voice AI and assisting Cartesia with their GTM for the narration feature for Substack writers. 

We're at a time where the general public is disillusioned by the fear of AI and want something that can understand their complicated feelings. companies like [hume ai](https://www.hume.ai/blog/what-is-semantic-space-theory) are building atop a framework for emotion called semantic space theory: with over 20 distinct emotional dimensions it maps _“the full specrtrum of human emotion_” by exploring the intricate gradations between feelings across cultures and contexts.

At Hume, I'd take a first principles approach to how we can launch Hume into new growth areas - especially within writing and creative communities. I believe I combine the right level of execution and empathy to hit the ground running with 

i've used hume to create a personal project for an emotions journal out of my voice notes, and been deeply impressed by the conbeen experimenting with ai tools that integrate emotional expression into digital communication, specifically through voice as a medium. [elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/best-practices/prompting#emotion) embeds emotions through context of the script and prompting, while [cartesia](https://docs.cartesia.ai/build-with-cartesia/capability-guides/control-speed-and-emotion#emotion-options) uses a simpler tag system. with just a few clicks, i can adjust how emotions color a synthesized voice—it's like having a new interface for expression, one that makes me reflect on how we naturally convey feelings.

Hume addresses the two things I care about deeply: building technology that’s emotionally intelligent and making it accessible to real communities. Having started my career exploring the ethical applications of AI at AI4ALL and in HCI research, I’ve long been interested in how technology can improve human well-being. Hume’s approach — grounded in Semantic Space Theory and reinforced by The Hume Initiative — is one of the most intentional and credible visions for how AI can become more empathic.

On the execution side, I’ve built and grown AI products from zero to one - at Microsoft, rapidly prototyped copilots to drive adoption of an AI infra platform for developers, and analyzed usage data with SQL to inform roadmap decisions. More recently, I’ve worked closely with the creator ecosystem — writing about voice AI, experimenting with personal projects like an emotion journal from my voice notes, and supporting Cartesia with GTM for Substack writers. Those experiences taught me both the mechanics of growth and the power of listening to what creators and developers actually need to create that fervent love for a product.

To me, Hume represents a new interface for human expression that creators, developers, and the every day person alike can adopt. What we need to do is lower the friction and show the value. I’d bring a first-principles attitude to finding those growth vectors, along with the empathy and execution to turn them into results.
