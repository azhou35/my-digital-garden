Description:

I'm devoted to frontier technology that expands humanity, as well as the humans who live at the center of it all.  

Current TPM at OpenAI. Previously at Microsoft Supercomputing. Drawn to systems-level thinking and probing the pressure points where large systems fail. 

You can find my thoughts online here, and my photos here. 

Jersey-grown, Manhattan-aged. 



More About Me:

Jersey-grown, Manhattan-aged, they graduated from Cornell University . 

Someday, she hopes to pull at the seams until the story unravels. Her visual and written work centers themes of authenticity and the continuous search for self. By way of an early love of poetry, she seeks out the hidden threads.

Cultivating creative communities through photowalks, galleries, and writing clubs.

**Ephemera**




I spend my days making the invisible legible, tracing the patterns that shape how progress, both physical and digital, takes form.

My work sits at the intersection of systems and storytelling. At Microsoft, I helped orchestrate one of the world's largest GPU fleets. I deeply believe in democratizing access to tech: I started my career developing AI learning materials and contributing to open-source for NLP tools. 

Outside of work, I write techno-social essays and curate creative spaces through Wayward, a project exploring how we create meaning, memory, and art in an increasingly digital world. I'm fond of random walks and wandering, fascinated by urbanism, computational poetry, and data visualization. 

Through everything, I aspire to build bridges between the logical and the lyrical. If anything here resonates, I'd love to hear what you're building, writing, or thinking about.


I believe in following the sparks of curiosity. 

run photo walks, creative clubs, and a newsletter called anniething, anniewhere, where I document notes on community, culture, and becoming.
