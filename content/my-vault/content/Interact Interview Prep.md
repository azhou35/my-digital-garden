Things to prep:
* who are you?
	* im annie and im a storyteller working in product in new york


	* prev i studied data science at cornell, did a lot of work in data visualizations, where i led the product community and incubated ed-tech web apps to solve problems of the student community
	* day job i work on microsoft's supercomputing software team
	* writing immensely impactful to my career - started out documenting tools for NLP & gaming at Amazon, to writing strategy for Microsoft Research's partnership w drug discovery tartups
	* "storytelling is uniquely powerful, as they set the vision, values, and agenda ofthe next generation"
	* moved to nyc last year
	* writer & photographer 
		* im always searching for stories -- as much of a technologist im an anthropologist
		* within writing
		* 1) i write prose that humanizes technology & considers personal questions on identity & creativity
		* 2) im building a writing community within nyc of friends who are interested in cultural, societal questions 
			* i believe everyone has a compelling way of viewing the world, and writing is an excellent way to draw it out
			* organizing micro communities with writing club - how can we take community building one step further, and incite genuine relationships and collaborations amongst new friends
* **Why Interact?**
	* i rlly resonate w interact's ethos for contemplation & execution 
	* always grew up interetested in the humanities in stem environments
		* i went to a stem high school but was the literary girl -- running lit mag,
		* went to an ai ethics program in high chool that incepted an early interst in fairness in ml
		* at college most of my peers came from cs classes, but i joined reboots online fellowship to talk to other technologists
	* i thrive off of open-ended questions 
	* "space for mutual support, unbashed curiosity, humble ambition"
	* moving to nyc last year ive had luck meeting technologists who are interested in writing 
		* ran writing club and meetups as a way to hear their opinions 
			* thru writing club i see how vibrant friendships can be when we are similarly intentional and vaue-driven
		* want to build upon the perspective ive molded from those conversations and interact empowers me with two things:
				* 1) a diverse community of of ppl in a wider range of fields to talk to 
					* as i figure out my own definition of a technologist and how i want my values to inform my decisions, diversity is important
					* opportunity for meta conversatoins about the work we're doing
				* 2) the accountability and frameworks to actually go out and execute the big question we conider 
	* honestly finding a sense of place
		* ive been "decentralized" for a while, having left college early 
			* very slip into complacency, lose your momentum, and be content with your structure -- i want to avoid that
			* amongst my new grad friends theres a common mentality that after college this is it: all the striving we did was to get the full time job we have now. im discontent w this and believe we just need to use our imagination. i want to be excited by possibility, not feel like its clo
		* i think you are a sum of the 5 ppl closest to you and finding community that aligns with ur values and being uber specific about itis crucial
* **howd you find out about interact?** 
	* from curius
	* its a browser extension where i can see what other interesting people find interesting 
	* 
**What would you do in interact**
* **what are your values?**
	* authenticity, curiosity, and compassion
		* i believe the people who 1) find what is truly interesting to them 2) rabbit hole into the problem and 3) care about what their soution entails
* **what is something ur passionate about?**
	* 1) interested in linguistics x tech
		* language provides a window into human nature -- reveals what ppl are thinking and feeling 
		* role of poetry in society -- its insanely elegant how it can encapsulate so many layers of meaning into such few words, by extension im intrigued by -- relevant to the age of ai because poetry / metaphors is a vessel for reasoning and meaning, can ai write poetry? can it translate it between languages? 
		* How do native speakers maintain such elaborate language rules, and transfer them to children, without knowing the rules themselves? We have a subtle understanding of our world, even if we don’t describe it in that way.
		* computer generated poem -- how can tech generate new affordance for poems?
		* the words we use to describe technology and how it mytholizes it, almost obfuscates acocuntability -- "the algorithm"
		* "language and thought" -- though disproven, how do diff words reflect the values of a culture? how people orient themselves in space, or view time and color? language is what informs how we view the world 
		* language as a vessel of informing cultural patterns
			* some of my fav factoids involve how certain words came to be
			* ![[Pasted image 20241006102355.png]]
	* 2) - What role does literature play in helping readers to understand the conditions shaping AI’s rise and to seek alternative possibilities to what might be assumed or elided now?
		* eg every time i see something new in tech, i think of a short story from ted chiang or ken liu 
		* speculative fiction 
	* 3) algorithms flattening our culture and eroding our authencity / identity formation -- a lot of my peers' interests are based on what they see on tik tok 
		* track the history of how advertising in general has incepted desires in people and how that relates to technology 
	* 4) interested in anxiety / philosophy
		* rabbit holed into anxiety thru kierkegaard and sartre 
		* sartre: existentialism
		* * kierkegaard: anxiety and despair are essential to human experience 
			* how do we live life authentically, and how do individuals give meaning to life themselves, not thru society or religion 
		* sartre: anxiety manifested in choice of actions, bad faith,
			* anguish of freedom / diszzines
	* good city design -- 
		* study abraod in copenhagen wa suhc a case study in well designed cities
		* what kind of spacedo you provide between buildings?
		* how do u encourage ppl to congregate in squares? 
		* what kind of public transportation and fees do we establish 
		
* **What do you think of technology's role in society**
	* i think people as a whole fall into two main camps re tech in society:
		* ppl outside of tech who view it as a macroeconomic force, dont quite understand the details but interested in how its going to affect society/other industries
		* ppl within tech who see it from the inside out, since youre working 
	* As technologists we often forget its macro role in society
	* even amongst the ppl i talk to, we're usually limited in what' changeable in our current scope
	* we have to think *bigger* -- what are the big changes we wanna see in society and how can we work backwards from there?
		* eg what if social media was incentivized by qualitative rather than quantitative metrics? what the new form of writing media now that theres 1) gen ai and 2) cambrian explosion of content? 
		* thinking about mmorpgs in the past, how that affects online relationships, and how that latent ambient presence affects how we feel connected to each other
* **Thoughts on writing itself**
	* Writing is a way to reflect afterwards and before -- to sort out intention
* What is your fav piece of technology
* What is one contentious view on technology you hold
* notes from interact research:
* What I need to show:
	* passion/excitement/ambition/uniquely insightful/open minded conversationalist/risk taking self starter 

* staring into the abyss:
	* https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/
	* thining reasonably about things that are uncomfortable to reason*
	* - Another situation where people often procrastinate on staring into the abyss is when they take a job that turns out not to be very good. It’s common for people stay in these jobs for a surprisingly long time, even when the job market in their field is very hot and they could easily find a better position somewhere else.
    
    Thinking about whether to leave your job is uncomfortable in a few different ways: it involves acknowledging that you made a poor decision in the past (taking your current job) that wasted a bunch of time; it involves signing up for a bunch more difficult, stressful work to interview at new jobs; and it saps your motivation to invest in getting better at your current job if you think it’s likely that you’ll leave soon. So it’s understandable that people procrastinate on staring into that abyss. But that procrastination leads to a lot of avoidable suffering.
