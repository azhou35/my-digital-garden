[[the light is most golden just before the shadows fall]]
[[notes on eleven]]
### how to begin
you are told, *to be young is to be constantly on the precipice of perfection.* you are told, "adolescence is a delicious last gasp of rightful selfishness and cluelessness."

you were told the day you were born, it was a a rare 72 degree day in early march, that your mom entered the hospital with a bright yellow jacket and left wearing a t-shirt. completely changed.

these days, the winter darkness stings a bit deeper in february, the type of bone-chill that clutches in lemmas of stillness. it's lucky february's a short month. 

the light is most golden just before the shadows fall. in moments of blinding light, there is no limit to what shape your shadows will take. 

this past year, you have been in a magnificent hurry. go to all the restaurants, read all the books, listen to every type of music. you satiate your appetite, but a hunger still remains. a "a hunger not so much for knowledge as for experience... the future experience, the state of perfectly cultivated being, that awaits you at the end of the search"

*once you’ve read everything, then at last you can begin.*

in the penumbra of youth, how do you know where the shadow begins and where it ends?

when i was eleven i appropriately read Sandra Cisneros' piece, *Eleven*: "**What they don't understand about birthdays and what they never tell you is that when you're eleven, you're also ten, and nine, and eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four, and three, and two and one.**"

ever since then these words have wormed their way deep into your psyche and resurface in the disappearing days of february. 

when you were eleven when you were eighteen you dramatically proclaimed *my childhood is dead, and i have killed her!* to no one in particular. 

 you have always been in a rush to grow up, wrestling with an unspoken timer, teetering in between the fulcrum and edge of life's seesaw. if your life were 24 hours you constantly mistake sunrise for sunset, forever. 

 when you were 18 you proclaimed my childhood is dead, and i have killed her. bobbing sail boats tethered to the dock.

## autopsy 

i write myself into being. i write towards a life sentence.

writing is an act of identity making—every word a clavicle, every sentence an organ. No wonder we call it a body of work. *To write is to attempt the revelation of this elusive, multifaceted self, yet its total revelation is a chimerical impossibility. It is impossible to convey all the truth of all our experience.*

this substack, this strange lil writing habit i've cultivated since eleven and brought into public perview at twenty-two - each piece serves as an active offering of who i'm becoming. each essay is a mirror and a chisel, reflecting and shaping my identity simultaneously. 

sometimes when people ask my age i've said 22 with a sheepish grin. i simultaneously want to be older and ageless at the same time. age-agnostic, perhaps, because i feel just as angsty and confused and unsettled as i did age eleven, and probably will at age thirty. 




meaning-making functions as a daily wrestle with light.

[[zadie smith on writing]]
at the edge of february i went to the beach on a rare sunny day. we took the N down to coney island, unprepared for the desolate and empty boardwalk that would greet us. the last time i've been here was when i was sixteen, first summer taking pictures, bulky nikon in hand as i took over-posed portraits of people to achieve some brandon woelfel aesthetic. 

staring at the ocean, the new friend i made had commented that the foggy ship in the distance reminded them of the word for fear of the ocean. *thalassophobia*

is there a word for fear of the sky? once an ex had visited me in new york and commented, bitterly, that he couldn't see the sky here. imprisoned in concrete jungle. 
sometimes i wonder if he saw cages when i see mountains to climb. 

i don't like emptiness. at the sight of an empty canvas all the coins inside me start rattling. restless.
li young lee once said - look at the birds: even flying is borne out of nothing. 
it's this prospect of flight that terrifies me, an [[icarian task]] where the sheer weight of my aspirations drill my feet back into my ground. 

there's a very human draw towards looking up into the sky, idolizing shooting stars and the like. i don't want to sit still - i want to slowly pulse in and out, until the pressure is too much and i burn. to be 23 feels like tension - i yearn for roots but i crave wings.  
### at 30
[what should a 30 year old be?? - by tina zhang](https://substack.com/home/post/p-157361174)

it feels silly to fixate on ageing when i know today, this day, i am the youngest i ever will be. when so many fellow writers i look up to have written reflections recently that reference this age of *twenty-two* fondly. 

at twenty-two i discussed with multiple people, on first dates and friend hangs, what they would want to be at age 30. 

it's a question that's hard to fathom, the gulf between 23 and 30 overwhelming in its vastness. tina is right - it feels so far away that it becomes an abstract idea. who do i want to be at age 30 requires me to confront who i am now, and that is a target that is ever-changing. who i am at thirty is also layers of me at 29, 28, 27, all years that i have no line of sight into. 

in the morning of the turn i told N that i feel like ageing feels like im losing my margin for error. immediately he points out it's actually the opposite - your decisions at an earlier age have more of an impact compared to later. for example, messing up your grades in high school can arguably have more compounding effects than slacking off at work in your 20s. 

the older i get, the more layers of age i will accumulate, each layer inherently thinner than the year before that. i believe there will be a time that i care less, in a good way. at age thirteen i cared so much, so brittle and sensitive, such that when my mom surprised me at sunday school with a sheet pan costco cake i was embarrassed. at sixteen i read some side snarky messages from a teammate on a group project and spent the first hours crying.

there will be a time that i collect so many coins in my jar that they no longer rattle. at thirty these things will probably bounce off me, since i spent so much time in my earlier years holding onto them and letting go. 

## return to self 
for my birthday this year, i invited friends to a home cafe set in my friend's apartment. i drew menus and made stickers and prepared matcha the night before. in the bright light on sunday afternoon, i had filled up a space with all my favorite humans.

i've been running spare cycles on what's in common across my friends. on a "find the guest" bingo card there are some obvious shared traits - friends who come from work, those who share my hobbies, even those who i just met. 

but there are some intangibles i picked up on during the event, seeing everyone chat with each other so well. its the way michelle made cookie batter the night before and came early to blow up balloons. shirling waking up at 9 to make a cake adorned with flowers kristie bringing her cam everywhere. it's the way justin started quietly cleaning up the finished cake plates and drink cups. gary whipped out his heavy-weight sony and snapped away. how when it came time to cut the cake, there were four cameras of different fidelities to look at. 

i'd pin my friends as all generous, but that isn't a specific enough word. they share a genorosity of their time, which is so much more capped than monetary value. 

around the end bahar went up to me and commented how lovely it was that everyone was so easy to get along with and that its really a reflection of whos in my life.

i write myself into being. but i shape my identity not in isolation, but in tandem with my friends, within this warm community. they say you are the sum of your five closest friends - by surrounding myself with people who i admire and i care about, i am defining who i am and who i want to become. i am not a sum of my resume but rather a sum of my community. i want to be kind, i want to be earnest, i want to be good and true. humans, they frustrate and delight me, and maybe that's all that love really is. 

in that sun-drenched apartment, surrounded by friends, I realized something about light and shadow. We don't grow up by stepping fully into the light of understanding, but by learning to dance at the edges where light and shadow meet. My friends—each carrying their own interplay of certainty and doubt—help illuminate these edges.

i am delighted by humans above all. 

for my birthday .





generosity of time is a quality you cannot optimize: but the core of friendship is a mutual buy-in from both parties. it's an inherent social contract that you will invest in each other and you will allocate some of your precious time thinking about them. it's saying *let me help you with this* and helping with small tasks at a house party. it's michelle and ruthie inviting telling annie about their run and immediately inviting her to run with them. 



humans, they frustrate me and delight me all at the same time. perhaps that is what love is.
