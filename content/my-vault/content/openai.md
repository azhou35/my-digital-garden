will i be happy at openai?
why did i want to join in the first place?
will i be fulfilled?
- sierra lets me have it all - in person nyc startup office, customer facing tpm job, lower prestige but you get to keep all the photo / writing things that make me happy 

will i thrive/succeed?
- goal is to quickly bring up new capacity - get it operational within a week's notice 
- high churn and poor management, will be constantly firefighting 
- high pressure environment where performance is a must
- extremely serious and mission driven 
- they could fire me at any second
but the outcome is so unimaginable
- extremely rare and difficult to get this position in the first place
- best thing to do after my current work at microsoft - builds on momentum and leverages unique mix of young spirit & domain experience
