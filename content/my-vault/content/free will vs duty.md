title: "free will vs duty"

free will/radical freedom
- capitalism promises the dream that with hard work and grit you can get to some outcome
- you have agency and ability to change your own given circumstances
- self efficacy: the belief and use of you own skills to shape your fate

HOWEVER

it leads to a high sense of individualism that can further disconnect you from society. harder to find purpose and meaning when you live solely for yourself.

hence why we live in a crisis of meaning. the illusion of free choice from being able to post anything on the internet and attract brands or start businesses or quit your job or manipulate a relationship. freedom lends itself to a lack of commitment. unlimited choice leads to decision paralysis and nihilism. on tik tok feed we're flooded with life paths, choices to optimize ourselves. fed *aphorisms* like, *you could do anything.*

one could, in theory, do anything. we have freedom to jump off a cliff, quit our job, turn away from our friends - but is it really freedom when you have to ignore all consequences and responsiblity to do it? 

*we are condemned to be free*

### technology accelerates agency

history was shaped by the meaning we inherited from religion and cultural tradition. but forcing yourself into duty also questions if it's purpose. technology was a tool for humans to *shape their fate* - each innovation is a small win over circumstance, from creating fire to tame the night to telephones to close distances to modern-day innovations in bioinformatics to manipulate gene sequences. 

it's no wonder a god complex is shared by technologists - you have found a way to seize your fate and steer it to your beckoning, raise mounds of capital at the whim of a dream.

men used to go to war and now we picket healthcare policies, pick our fights with the world. no longer we go to war, we invent our own reasons for war. the climate crisis, population decline, etc. 
it's a wonderful evolution: there are endless problems and now a growing taskforce of ambitious folks to tackle them. 

yet, while culture celebrates building and action, there's often insufficient reflection on _what_ we're building and _why_. why toil over skyscrapers that no one will use? why disrupt the environment to generate endless videos without soul? 

as nadia reflects, this leads to a kind of purposeless productivity - lots of activity but potentially misdirected energy because the underlying ideas haven't been properly examined or understood.

"it is you who is caged. freedom is all you life for." what is the point of radical freedom if it leads to a meaningless life? 

our tools for freedom have become our own prison. free time is a misnomer - the only form of currency that is never re-printable is our number of hours. yet we assume it is limitless, so we dawdle and dally, our attention floating from side quest to side quest without any unified journey. 

"until you make the unconscious conscious you will let it direct your life and you will call it fate"

to move fast and break things is to neglect real-world social consequences - e.g. 
### a crisis in meaning

we live for a boundless life. duty, which once defined traditional society, is viewed as a constraint. but without duty we lose access to an easy pathway to purpose and a meaningful life. 

responsibility is a necessary simplification mechanism to reduce the overwhelming complexity of possible lives. in theory i could choose to live anywhere in the world, even trance off into europe for some time - but the very real constraint is the filial piety i feel towards my parents in jersey. i could picture myself quitting my job in favor of some artistic pursuit - but i cannot do so without considering some future family of mine, and how to provide them with the best life as my parents have done for me. 

more egregiously, one could optimize for profits and sell off the metadata of their users; one could optimize for engagement and farm for likes with clickbait-y articles. 
(maybe this is the danger of ai-driven technology. technology has no soul and no moral compass, and they dont have the human aversion to hurting others.)


as hegel once wrote on human will and freedom: [[content/hegel on human will and freedom|hegel on human will and freedom]] - real freedom isn't the absence of constraints, but the intentional alignment with something larger than our individual desires.

*"Hegel believed the will is inherently free, but its freedom is expressed through reason and self-consciousness. It's not just about making choices, but about understanding the reasons behind those choices and aligning them with a rational, universal purpose. "*

this frame of mind concedes that there is some universal *purpose,* much as modern society tries to shy away from this.

*"i do not control the wind, i study it."*

do we wish to be architects of our life? ruthlessly obsessed with every contour of our future house, concrete straight lines dictating a blueprint? 

or rather, the wise gardener. who tends to their field, giving shape by way of natural forces. - "The master gardener shapes through patient understanding of natural forces, while the architect imposes through blueprint. Technology has made us all architects of our own lives, but perhaps we need more gardener-like wisdom"

instead of a top down systems-design approach, imagine how things evolve in biology, from the bottoms-up. each species involved in the ecosystem is donig what makes sense, but these individual actions culminate into a stasis. 

"fate is like a sword. only those who can wield it can control it."

a bird who still returns to the falconer. 

self-determinism

this post is incited by the premise of hbo's *shogun,* a show depicting the culture shock of a english sailor as he is dropped into feudal japan. here, western individualism directly combats eastern fatalism. through fatalism, you believe one's life / death was pre determined. counterintuitively, accepting death allows them to live life with greater purpose, as they're freed from fear and empowered to act with intention.

in samurai society, fate was a complex concept due to a struggle between predetermined destiny and the samura's agency to shape their fate thru actions. samurai would maintain a mindset where they could face any eventuality with clarity and purpose. 


it's not just we critique freedom - but we lack the correct community and ritual to make sense of it. 

### the ideas of how to combat this
from nadia: "real ideology of technology is. it's not this libertarian thing; it's actually this very individual ambition path into collectivism."

we've taken technology to its end case - magnifying one aspect of human nature (the desire for control) while neglecting others (the need for belonging).

the next step is not to revert back to feudal times, nor abandon our highly autonomous modes of actions - but rather land somewhere in the middle. to understand not only what we build but articulate why we build. i'm a fan of general manifestos about techno-society - see [Letters to a Young Technologist](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/) , [⚡️ Take Back the Future! - by Jasmine Sun - Reboot](https://joinreboot.org/p/manifesto),  [The Philosopher-Builder - Cosmos Institute](https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/the-philosopher-builder).

do not abandon your agency, but take control of it. 
*to try to understand the world, to imagine something different, and to build something that fulfills that vision* and enable our humanity; to invest in investigating our own moral framework 

- new curation architecture - where before elders/priests/respected ppl in society filtered our possibilities, how do we embed this into our algorithmic discovery? 
- how do we intentionally narrow our possibilities, use technology to guide us to alignment with our internal compass
- what chosen constraints do we add back into our life? 

if an artist is given a blank canvas, they may freeze. but given four colors, you compel prioritization and clarity. 

sometimes the fate or our circumstances gives us a color palette to work with. this structure is what makes freedom meaningful.
