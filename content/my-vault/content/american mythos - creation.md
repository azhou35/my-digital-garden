title: "american mythos - creation"
---

why are we so bad at maintenance?
-> culture organized around *creation* not continuation

- founding / frontier expansion / disruption
we are the entrepreneur, not the operator 

politics favors capital projects, one time spending 
labor is 
- devalued and racialized 
- externalize maintenance costs to the future 
	- treating repair as someone else's problem
- we prioritize novelty over continuity
