title: "good infra tpm principles"
---

- Excellent organisational skills. I'll procrastinate with tasks I don't want to do and a TPM will nudge me in the right direction.
    
- Understands the org structure and has good relationships with peers/teams from other depts. It's great for cross team collaboration when the TPM has a relationship with other teams as they can aid in kicking off that initial conversation.
    
- Positive attitude. I'm an engineer. I'm also English. Being cynical and pessimistic is in my blood. I've always found a positive TPM to be a great balance. Of course, this point could apply to anyone in the team, not just a TPM but I've found that it's usually the TPMs who have the positive attitude.
    
- General team admin tasks. Small things but just make my life easier. Proactive in sorting out meetings, owning the awkward intros, sorting out Jira things and.
    
- Someone to bounce ideas off after meetings with leadership. This one may not be applicable to everyone else but one of my weaknesses is applying technical solutions to meet business goals. I find it immensely useful to have a debrief with my TPM after such meetings to help talk through what was said.
