Academics, practitioners, and users, claimed that infrastructures become visible only when they crumble and fail. In other words, infrastructures are meant to be invisible.



And it is not just infrastructures as objects that we learn to un-see, but infrastructures as people, as maintainers, as caregivers, who are made to disappear into the background
As a system that organizes, builds, governs, and sustains everyday life, infrastructure has long been wrapped up in politics of imperialism, settler colonialism, and racial capitalism


There’s a great opportunity here related to urban technology. I personally believe that within our lifetime we will have to figure out how to rethink the way American settlements are made and how they operate. We have to rethink how we get our water, how we get our power, and how we store and transmit it. We have to rethink how we move, how we eat, how we govern ourselves. All of this is necessary because it’s clear that the design standards of the infrastructure we have did not contemplate the climate we are now living within. Much of our current infrastructure is too fragile or brittle to survive. Where is that reinvention going to happen?



Resilience now alters the metrics, however. Although everyday price efficiencies have been the key measure for nearly a century, in what was a monoculture based on centralized economies of scale, much has reversed in recent decades of decentralization, digital control systems, and increasingly two-way traffic. Disruptions accelerate this reversal, not only from centralization, but also from the all-or-nothing monoculture of what stays on. For example a town might pay three times the normal infrastructure cost to power a resilience hub where people can meet and pump water and charge their phones in an emergency.
