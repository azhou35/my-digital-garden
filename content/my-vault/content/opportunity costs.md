title: "opportunity costs"
---

inspired by Martyr and Kaveh Akbar
"this idea that he is “obsessed with the opportunity cost of writing and reading.” It’s a great gift of your time and energy to read a book. You could be doing literally anything else, but you spend maybe 10-12 hours or more reading a novel."

* the tradeoff between art and something "productive"
* our entire 20s is grappling w this opportunity cost
	* fig tree theory right 
* high intention but you cant dictate everything
