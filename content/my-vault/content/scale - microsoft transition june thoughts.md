the argument to leave
i feel ready to make this bet on myself. it really is a question of where do i want to allocate the early years of my 20s - is it laying patient for my inner work to bloom in the confines of a safe big tech company, or is it running headfirst into the chaos of a startup? 
i want to make the decisions that will lead to compound gains in the future. 

game plan:
tell aditya by june 10

"One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been."

aditya - want to tell you about a hard decision im thinking through 
be honest - i think this is a great opportunity and u gave me a great opportunity
everything is pretty slow and suppot a platform operationalize process 
coordination to run these things
feel theres a different opportunity to turn something into startup 
theres a lot of things i wanna learn 
i will always think of you 
and 
hey in the future 
im not a hardware person
im more of a data person 
I know this will come as a surprise given our recent conversations about the next 6 months and the OAI work. I wasn't actively looking when this opportunity came up, but it's made me realize I need to be more intentional about my career direction
i want to emphasize that the amount of support and investment in my growth you and amy have provided is beyond comparison. and this decision isnt a reflection of my experience on your team, but moreso the unfotunate reality of working at a large tech company. 
ur hesitation is there a while
u think its a good time

You're optimizing the speed of a trajectory you don't actually want.

You fundamentally want to be a product manager.

I'd need to give my notice next week, with my last day being [date]. I want to make sure we have a solid transition plan for the OAI maintenance work

you need cognitive load
boredom is ur enemy


logical optimization question - how do you price your values
- something adjacent would be exciting
- deployed engineer is a mess - getting intesne projects
- ur goal at role is the most producty role u can get at scale
- no clear diff between what u and he does
- no boundaries between tpm and pm
- market viability - total universal startups
- market is gonna move more quickly
- pms can either compress or increase
- scale is an outlier in how it got super big - super necessitated getting big
	- now theyre doing platform
- snorkel has fewer ppl
- ask about the dna and types of ppl
	- scale is notoroius for hiring junior our bg
- is everyone from microsoft going to databricks + coreweave - prettydiff than geting product exp that is transferable to other infra companies

what do u want at this point? 
* if you want fast career growth and increase the surface
* u have to be in environment 
* justin empathizes - give up all ur happy routines
* just having that is not making me happy now
* fulfillment comese from building something and being part of something
* incremental event does not help the same way finding value in ur work
* feels a bit hedonistic planning these events
* biggest existential angst - if i sink too hard to the other side will be unhappy bc i care about balance

imposing justins philosophy on annie now:
* r u gonna feel more fulfilled n the short term/long run
* question is whether scale is better than what u get
	* role makes sense
	* company is in great position
	* environment and caliber 
	* product ur working on
	* hard to imagine that if u want to do something in the model space
* if ur working on evals its the perfect wedge into anything
* question si whether u feel u wanna eat shit in the short term and the right thing to be diong
* in the short term, ur either planning against the pressure or the grind 
	* vs existentialism and the passively recruiting for 6-12
	* justin would rather grind rather than be exisetential
	* justin started recruiting last july - foundation
	* had vc phase for 6 months 
	* it sucks
	* trading off 
	* take an L either way 
	* eihher in ramping up or gtting into the grind 
	* or feeling antsiness that  u want to leave 
	* and pushing hard on sending emails and intro calls
	* its a diff burn out
	* rather would trade the grind burnout 
	* sacrifices do make sense 
	* upfront cost
	* going to have to grind at no matter what startup
* its always a grind
	* scale wont necessariily be more grind
* long term
	* ur gonan come out of it rlly glad that u took this opportunity that u expanded set of options
	* u come out the other side
	* marktes gonna be different
	* uncertainty 
	* dont know if things will be that different
	* that is what ustin optimizing for - taking the thing thats gonna create change and fundamentaly shift ur pov and exposure
	* cant konw whats gonna happen in the next 5 years
	* if justi stays where hes going to now, its not gonna be fundamentally diff 
	* if he doesnt think an extra year is going to meaningfuly change ur chance at a good fund
* just rlly about slope 
* optimizing for slope earlier is always better 
* jutin feels like he hasnt grown professionally in the past 3 years 

what i care about in my job:
- company relevance - is this a crucial company within ai?
- role - is this a customer facing, generalist, technical ish but dont need to deliver code role? ideally pm where im shipping features?

Core Question:
* How do you price your values? 
* What do I want out of life? 
	* Is it the hedonistic but enjoyable, balanced life that comes with a chil 9-5? With ample time to workout, hang out with friends on weekdays, and write during the work?
	* Or is it the grind where you can't rationaly justify how hard you work? 
* If the question is will Scale better than what you can get
	* It's hard to say no: 
		* * role makes sense
		* company is in great position
		* high environment and caliber 
		* relevant product ur working on
		* hard to imagine that if u want to do something in the model space
* Am I willing to wait for the next 3-6 months and passively recruit?
	* Will continue to be dissatisfied with the type of work at microsoft and search for meaning in my post work? 
* Would u rather make a change and grind now? Or continue to be existential? 
* How does 20-30 hours doing something meaningless vs 70 hours building something
* What drains you? Long hours or meaningless work? 
* Perfamnce anxiety
* What kind of person do you want to be ? 
	* Path A: Optimization Life at Microsoft with max free time, energy, financial security
		* Pursue work as necessary but separate
		* Pursue meaning outside of work
	* Path B: Scale
		* Meaning thru challenging, impactful work
		* Bet on frofessoinal growth creates future optionality 
		* Trajectory > current growth
* You're worried about failing to become the person u want to be.
	* Testing a core belieff about who you are
	* Does ur self-concept match reality? 
* Where do i want my creative/community efforts wanna go? 
* 



Current Deal at Microsoft:
Pros:
* GPU maintenane for OAI is strategic
* Potential Promo by summer (1 year early) + path to growth
* 20-30 hours/week of actual effort
* Mentor (aditya) rlly cares about my growth as i was his former intern, invested in bringing me up
Cons:
* Moreso project coodination & reporting, less so technical product work 
* Operaional overhead: tracking, reporting, presenting 
	* Administrative
* Burnout in a different way: existential burnout from administrative burden + lack of focus 

Future Deal at Scale:
Pros: 
* Evals is fundamental to AI 
* Team would directly impact model development
* Exposure to model eval/safety/benchmarking
* Better optionality for exit opportunities 
* Opportunity to move into Product Managemnet 
	* Define how AI systems get tested and validated 
	* Ship features
* Acquiring new skills 
* Impressive PM Manager (John Solitario)
Cons:
* 50-60+ hours with higher intensity 
	* Fundamental shift in cognitive load
* Going from full remote to work in person 
* Slight cut in pay (possible -10k per year, 30-70k in RSUs)
* Missing out on promo/growth path/trust of microsoft pms

JUSTIN THANK YOU ugh ur thoughts are actually insanely keen
my backup plan rlly is waiting 4 more months for a theoretical opportunity thats more "perfect" - aka alignment w work culture along w role/company/stage
but if i assume scale is the best for all these factors, and a different statup would have a similar work culture, then its rlly not a fair comparison between scale and a proposed future startup
its so rare to get a well-compensated job for just admin work but the sense of ennui is going to persist for an extremely long time 
like excluding literal promo trajectory, its clear id learn more in another year at scale compared to another year at microsoft - i have a pretty good sense of what ill be doing (and its more spreadsheet work)
its like the same tradeoff someone would go into consulting or mba even if ur making some tradeoff ur betting that the exit opps are better 
and staying at microsoft in the project coordination role i exist in now can open the door to more project coordination roles at large companies but its def gonna close the door on any job role asking u for exp in "shipping XX gen AI products"
also ++1 that fulfillment comes from building something and being part of something - there's some plateuing marginal returns in each new sidequest/event that i pursue - it just feels like im trying to stack on random things in my hobbies to compensate for no structural integrity in my work life
i feel SUPER hedonistic rn and ive been in this state for so long it feels strange to consider another reality 
but it just fundamentally doesnt feel right

what to tell parents:
* options can be worth a lot
* going to get equivalent stck/options 

from claude:
microsoft path has a ceiling

opportunity alignment:
* model evals is critical as ai scales
* data platform work touches every ai companys core needs
