### day 1 of catskills 
*log*
- uber from union square -> upstate -> 2 hr drive
- pulled up to such a beautiful cabin hidden in the woods 
	- 4 rooms, stout long white couches, a view of the rolling hills 
- went to grab coffee + ingredients and kept getting side tracked by different parts of the town 
- sent out my final messages for work 
- mahesh & i drove out to catch golden hours at 5 
	- driving on the roads wandering to find the place whre the light would strike - maybe somewhere in the west? 
	- wasnt sure if we could get pics but we pulled to the side
	- saw the fall leaves
	- took pictures of each other
	- moment of silence where we sat on the grass and watched the view 
- jenny pulled out the metal wine bowl 
	- serving wine - riesling, red wine, orange wine 

### day 2 of catskills
- made my ube pancakes
- went on "hike"
	- jenny pointing out the cute little parts of plants 
	- like the fuzzy moss
