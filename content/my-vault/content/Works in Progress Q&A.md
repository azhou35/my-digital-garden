title: "Works in Progress Q&A"

What area of scientific progress would you like to write about?  

I'm interested in exploring how the physical infrastructure behind technological progress across computing and pharmaceutical fields (cloud, pharmaceutical) is reshaping the physical landscape of our cities and is dictated by public and private influences.
I'm particularly fascinated by how fundamental physics constraints—temperature control, power requirements, and cooling systems—create both engineering challenges that result in socioeconomic impacts.


For both of my interests I want to explore how fundamental physics properties - temperature, power, etc - can dictate the engineering ingenuity and scrappiness that drives the processes we build to deliver datacenters or pharmaceutical goods like vaccines.

particularly:
One story I have in mind is on the cities powering Silicon Valley: data center cities. Through the lens of Northern Virginia's "Data Center Alley," the world's largest concentration of data centers. While it creates significant tax revenue, it nets relatively few jobs compared to space used, and consumes unimaginable quantities of electricity. The article will explore how massive power and cooling requirements of these facilities strain local infrastructure, reshape governance relationships, and create paradoxical digital divides where information hubs neighbor communities with limited connectivity. Through historical comparisons to company towns and visual documentation of physical transformation, I'll reveal how the invisible backbone of our digital world is reshaping physical communities.
One story to drive is Northern Virginia
1. The New Industrial Cities: 
   - The city powering Silicon Valley: Northern Virginia's transformation by data centers
     * Power grid challenges (data centers vs. research facilities)
     * Cooling infrastructure demands
     * Skilled workforce housing and transportation
* An exploration on power (literally and policy wise) and how it affects the decisions and ultimately feeds into the local populations
	* digital redlining
* Parallel between historical factory towns and modern data center hosts
Why is this interesting: 
Growing up in Central Jersey, I witnessed Bell Labs' impact on my home community. An innovation hub transformed surrounding communities, creating both technological marvels and distinct socioeconomic patterns in housing, education, and local governance. I'm drawn to exploring how communities adjust when they host critical technological infrastructure without necessarily participating in its benefits—a pattern visible in both the Bell Labs era and today's data center boom, but with important differences in employment patterns, environmental impact, and community integration.

3. Infrastructure Bottlenecks in Modern Science:
   - Power density challenges: From AWS data centers to quantum computing facilities
   - How cities are adapting their power grids for both compute-heavy AI research and biotech manufacturing
   - Water usage conflicts between data centers, research facilities, and urban needs
   - The emerging competition for engineering talent between tech and biotech sectors

4. The Hidden Biology of Computing:
   - How large language models are transforming drug discovery
   - The computational challenges of decoding lost languages and their similarity to protein structure prediction
   - The engineering challenges of maintaining quantum coherence and their parallels to maintaining biological samples
   - How urban planning needs to adapt to support both biotech research facilities and computing infrastructure


The underlying questions: does the digital economy justify transforming our cities? What are the hidden costs of cloud storage? How is this reminiscent of historical plans for factories for silicon chips, etc? How can infrastructure decisions be steered in beneficial directions? How can they create new forms of inequality? 

What piece(s) do you most want to write during this fellowship? Why are these ideas interesting to you?  

I'm particularly excited about these potential pieces:

1. "Silicon to Cells: The New Industrial Cities": An exploration of how data center hubs like Northern Virginia are evolving to support both tech and biotech infrastructure. This piece would examine how the demands of AI computing are creating unexpected synergies and conflicts with biotech research needs.

2. "The Urban Power Problem": How the extreme power requirements of modern computing and research facilities are forcing cities to rethink their infrastructure. From Loudoun County's data centers to Boston's biotech corridor, how are cities managing the competing demands for power, cooling, and space?

3. "Heat, Power, and Progress": An analysis of how waste heat and power management from data centers could be reimagined to support biotech research facilities, creating new models of sustainable urban scientific infrastructure.

4. "Lost Languages and Lost Proteins": A comparative analysis of how we're using similar computational techniques to decode both ancient scripts and protein structures, and what this tells us about pattern recognition in complex systems.

5. "The Cold Chain Revolution": An exploration of how cooling infrastructure - from quantum computing to protein storage - is becoming the hidden bottleneck in scientific progress. This piece would examine how cities and research facilities need to evolve to support these growing cooling needs.

These ideas fascinate me because they represent both the physical manifestation of our digital and biological revolutions and the crucial intersections between different fields of scientific progress. As a TPM, I see how infrastructure decisions made today will shape scientific possibilities for decades to come. I'm particularly attuned to how systems thinking can either enable or constrain scientific advancement, and I believe understanding these connections is vital for steering technological progress in beneficial directions.

Please link to two (2) pieces of non-academic writing that you are most proud of. (If you share a Google Doc, please ensure permissions are open.)  

How many pieces of writing have you published on the Internet over the last 12 months? Provide links to some of them.  

> These could include writing on biotechnology, metascience, technology in China, the history of science, or just about anything in between. We will prioritize writers covering issues that are of interest to both of our organizations. This fellowship was made possible with support from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
