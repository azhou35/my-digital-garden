title: "guggenheim"

each in his own private blizzard.” -margaret atwood  
  
my favorite part of the guggenheim wasn’t the art — it was watching people watch the art, their heads craned to squint at the skylight, their hands pointing at the different exhibits. there’s that word, sonder, to describe the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own. i adore the street camera’s ability to peel back a stranger’s layers and project a story.  
  
on the 6 uptown, i listened to dhruv’s new album, which he sums up as “maximal, intimate, soulful.” i stared out the window, submerged in dissonance, as the outside blurred: “chaos, in a musical way.” it’s far too easy to get overstimulated in the city. this photowalk we decided to shoot in b&w first. take color away and you’re forced to focus on light & shadow, form & function.  
  
this is just to say: go stream “private blizzard”! go take a walk without music! go take a photo in black and white 🙂
