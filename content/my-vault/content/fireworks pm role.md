Hey Raymond!
Great chatting with you about Fireworks! Your journey resonated with me - I've been looking for that perfect intersection of technical depth and meaningful impact. I'd be keen to continue the conversation on PM opportunities - here's a short blurb + my resume!

As a TPM at Microsoft's AI Infrastructure team, I've built operational frameworks that improved GPU infrastructure reliability for AI customers like OpenAI, developed metrics informing hardware allocation, and optimized utilization across our AI supercomputing stack. Beyond the infrastructure side, I've led 0->1 initiatives in our growing genomics vertical, translating usage data into new product opportunities and prototyping solutions for new customer segments. 

What excites me about Fireworks is the chance to help rebuild the AI infrastructure stack more efficiently - creating better inference-layer tooling and optimizations that let AI apps scale without bleeding money. The Cloud PM role sounds perfect for combining my technical background with GTM strategy while wearing different hats in a fast-moving environment.


For a short blurb: 
* background in cloud PM work in terms of understanding infrastructure, GPU utilization, and GTM strategy. having worked on operational frameworks for optimizing GPU infrastructure, experience with high-value AI customers like OpenAI, work in strategic capacity planning
* At Microsoft, I've been deeply involved in optimizing GPU infrastructure utilization, creating operational frameworks that improved reliability for AI workloads, and developing metrics to inform hardware allocation decisions. I'd be excited to bring this infrastructure expertise to help Fireworks scale efficiently while creating compelling GTM offerings for different customer segments
* I've also experienced in the growth aspects of offerings for AI workloads - at Microsoft I identified expansion opportunities for our genomics vertical, leveraging usage numbers and prototyping 0 -> 1 

What excites me about Fireworks is the chance to wear different hats while focusing on meaningful problems. The Cloud PM role sounds like a perfect fit where I could leverage my infrastructure experience while helping shape how customers interact with your platform.

There’s room to rebuild the AI infrastructure stack: better software at inference-layer tooling, cheaper ways to handle GPU workloads, and optimizations that let AI apps scale without bleeding money.

platform: to simplify process of developing ,deploying, and finetuning gen ai models
optimizing & serving existing models - inference engine, model fine tuning, compound ai systems, serverless deployment 
addressing the gap between ai experiment and deployment

background in me:

- always been quite passionate about making it easier for everyone to unlock the superpower of technology - made ml curriculum in high school 
- studied data science in college -> joined microsofts ai infra team as a pm on the batch processing service for ai workloads, which serves as the underlying layer of the azure machine learning deployment suite, another big part of my job is building operational excellence in supercomputing for our biggest customers like oai
- experience rapid prototyping for hpc researchers
- - - always passionate about how can we reduce the friction for developers in using ai tools
	- technical writing for api tools, saw my own sister struggle w deploying her ai models , even makin curriculum on pytorch 
- researching a lot on the space - looking for smaller companies that are particularly innovating and building an inference engine from the grounds up , as well as companiees that are open-source at the onset 

how to deploy gen ai safely
how each enterprise defines safety is dif
- daily interaction w customers
	- responsible for engagement
- strategic roadmapping
- in the weeds of the technical
	- set clea constraints
	- curate marking datasets
	- deeply understand whats
- 3 pms - 2 designers
	- cpos
- 10-15 ml researchers
- ml engineers
- 10 engineers
- pm is responsible for working everyone 
- build new tools 
- technical space
- tpm space
- understanding deployment processes
- lot of flexibilit

Questions to ask:
1. What is ur role like at Fireworks 
2. What is the team structured like
3. How do you work across research / eng product
4. Big Tech PM -> startup
	1. Whend you know it was the right time to jump? 
5. How do you see demand for serverless AI deployment growing
6. Who are the primary users 
7. What experiences do you think are critical to your role
8. Inference speed as a differentiation - how do you think that edge will be compared to other inference engines like togehter ai? 
9. Compound AI systems seem like a natural depature from "bigger is better" arms race, and making it better for niche use cases
	1. Hodw does this messaging land with users 
10. Fireworks seems to have a developer - first ethos and contrasts w closed ecosystems like OpenAI
cloud tpm
and goto market
marketing - does non launch blog posts
pm will do with customer discovery
packaging
work pretty closely w eng manager
pods - led by a cofounder 6-7
what is the prioritzation look 
work w forward deployed team
solutions engineering
