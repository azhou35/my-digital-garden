List o functionality
Looks up node health/status for specific nodes (and can summarize key health signals like overall health, state, boot state, and any health/taint-style reasons affecting usability).
Searches for nodes using vendor identifiers (e.g., serial / chassis ID / IP / node name), then returns the matching node record(s) and status summary.
Lists cluster names for the vendor scope.
Lists node names in a given cluster for the vendor scope.
Can initiate a vendor-supported maintenance workflow on selected nodes (e.g., request that nodes be moved into a maintenance/drain flow), with safety checks to prevent overly large or unsafe bulk actions.
Can provide copy/paste operational commands for common maintenance steps (e.g., cordon/drain/reimage/uncordon), when asked.

maintenance has been 90% networking
either terminate or drain host 

eri 
- can drain / terminate
1) bucket
if its a repair workflow - let the automation take care of it

2) bucket
latency 
check a bad drive

when would u expect this manual trigger - where in the lifecycle 

in the past few week you had this hsot come bck once - manual trigger 

mark will be in charge of request
we had some work to do Terminating Repair

issues w it 
status of CREW - how to fix it
when u guys want us to initiate a repair or 

vendor-requested stuff

<16 node limit - what is the configurable limit
