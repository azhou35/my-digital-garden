background
- MIcrosoft wil spend $80 billion in 2025 Capex 
- AI infra defined as: 
	- data platforms, ai models,data center hardware (this is where i live ! hpc clusters, gpus, tpus, cooling systems), networking (fiber/ethernet), semicondutors (the actual specialized cpu/gpu chips), memory and storage
- On inference, we have typically seen more than 2X price-performance gain for every hardware generation, and more than 10X for every model generation due to software optimizations
- Inglewood - 5K nodes
	- Hardware Capex Per rack - $1.39Million
		- +Opex for hour per rack: 77.65$ an hour
	- Hourly cost for cluster: $125K
	- Monthly clost for cluster: $90M
- One H100 Rack = 32 GPUs = $2M Capex for one year, +570K YoY
- Inglewood Lite repreents a $900 Million Investment, YoY 

- We’ve heard a few industry experts make comments along the lines of: _No one will ever train a frontier model on the same data center twice_—by the time the model has been trained, the GPUs will have become outdated, and frontier cluster sizes will have grown
- Arms Race
