hca drop on 16th of june - 

pit servicing - upgrades everything all at once

cant test it out on buildout (tested on 1/1000 of the size to 30 minutes) 

internal test - mnlxos switch fw 

validation internally -  buildout - install ufm/hca - test for several days for a week

have not done testing for mnlx

hca is specific to sku

ufm + and switch are uncommon 

in order to optimizng testing time we want to whole stack

pull switch derisking forward

what would go on h100 cluster
we ma do something slightly diff is 

- get 4 racks for gb200 hca is on house
- hca is the interface guard in the machine 
- mnlx 
if we do testing prior 
- derisk the switch

june 16th

june 23 gb200 

most these issues are statisicaly rare
