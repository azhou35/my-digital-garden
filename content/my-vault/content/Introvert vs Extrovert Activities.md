I bill myself as an extrovert, but a lot of my hobbies are inherently solitary. There's an ideal number of participants in a conversation where I thrive -- typically four -- and anything after that my voice easily fades. As a result, I'm hopeless at group settings in house parties and feel most at ease in intimate 1:1s. 

"Extrovert" tendencies:
* **Going to random events**. I love to meet new people. This drives me to attend social events where I may only know 1 - 2 people, especially sourced from the Internet (X, Instagram, Partiful).
	* At the same time I'm starting to get tired of going to these random events - they tend to have low hit rate 
* **Hosting**. Huge huge fan of gathering my own friends together and trying to connect nodes from different friend circles in the hopes that they form a connection on their own. 
* **Being a huge texter.** Maybe this is just me being an over-sharer? I will externalize nonstop over text, Strava, Beli, Substack, etc. I get a kick out of being inappropriately authentic on a social media that typically expects simple text input.

"Introvert" tendencies: 
* **Photography** is a fantastic hobby for an introvert. At overwhelming social situations I can hide behind my camera. I like to float on the edges of a situation, always preferring to observe it in its [[syncresis]] rather than fully dive in.

* **Reading** is the classic introvert hobby that, despite many efforts to make it social (Reading Rhythms, Reading Groups, Book Clubs) requires 100% of my concentration. 
* **Running** is something I kicked off as a social activity to consistently meet up with a friend (at CMU, summer internships, etc). Since moving to NYC, I've kept it as an insular activity -- I rely on a daily morning run to clear my head, and the pressure of keeping pace with someone and meeting up with them creates too much friction for what I've maintained as a consistent habit. 

As you can see, no activity is completely tied to introversion/extraversion -- there's ways to draw out social behaviors in insular hobbies, and also moments of intense introversion during a social event.
