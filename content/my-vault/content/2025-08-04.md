good lolla experience
travelling has made me quite sensitive 

stray thoughts - i am sensitive when ppl snap at me when travellin
i have been writing on substack for a while to no avail 
i am grateful i have ppl to take care of me and buffer me from the real world 
fresh cherry tomatoes off the vine 
- they pop with tart sweetness
- berries in the summer 
- something about berry picking and yearning and longing and desire 
- memories always taste more sweet than reality 
should i write more emotionally?
why do i write? 
its partially for technology partially for humanity
really good time hanging out w justin and his sister

realization: my means to an end is not writing necessarily 
- i dont have the discipline nor desire to noodle into a book
its to use writing as a scaffolding for something more
i am too focused on the craft of the work, on the medium itself
rather than finding stories to lend well to the writing / photography


what i realized post sabrina: 
in order to succeed, sell a concept, not a singular entity
sell a *metaphor, a story, a brand*

san sabino sells mediterannean summer breeze.

Questions:
1. - _"What have you noticed about PMs who ramp quickly here — what do they typically figure out fast?"_ 
2. - _"Every company has its own version of what ‘great PMing’ looks like. How would you describe that here?"
3. - _"Is success in this role more about driving execution, navigating ambiguity, or shaping product strategy early on?"__
