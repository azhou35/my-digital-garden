title: "Why do I write on Substack"
---

[[A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox]]

Question: 
I was able to expand my audience just by virtue of personal writing. Now that I'm at 500 as of 2025, what do I do to 1) have a regular writing schedule and 2) 10x my audience?


Goals:
1) building community (- Use writing to create serendipitous connections, Build networks around specific technical interests, Create spaces for deep technical discussions, Foster relationships with other specialists in your field) 
2) document my learnings/explorations in public as I explore my multi-disciplinary interests and write about intersection points between different interests.
