today's musings:
- how can interfaces / maps spark second derivative thought? 
- how can we use ai as a creative collaborator / accelerator? 
	- a collaborator asks guiding questions that push back on your initial thoughts and steer it into alternative directions
		- aka like a cue stick striking a pool ball to send it flying askew 
- how can we utilize multimodal input to catalyze thought and accelerate creation? 
- to truly live out a dream you need to be a little crazy
	- aka to be a writer think about what you do day to day. 99% is just emails and admin work
- in defense of the humanities 
	- ken liu: 
- based on a list of my drivers / anti-patterns
	- i enjoy curiosity / intellectual aeesthetics, social learning, creative expression, tinkering 
- intimacy is less about staying small its about building resonance so the right people feel seen, inspired, challenged
	- i am not trying to be an influencer but rather a signal in the noise - a host of thoughtful spaces, conversations and ideas to attract other ppl who think deeply
- maps > lists 
	- each item on a map exists in some spatial awareness and the closer u are to each other indicates other things

My bio:

[Annie Zhou](https://www.instagram.com/liminalsp.ace/?hl=en) is Jersey-grown, Manhattan-aged. Her visual and written work center the themes of authenticity and an ongoing search for self within the fabric of a mimetic world. By way of an early love for poetry, she enjoys finding the hidden stories in the mundane everyday. In her free time, she enjoys bringing friends together to write and take photos together. 

Someday, she hopes to pull at the seams until the story unravels.



She grew up bored in the suburbs, and has been chasing stories in the mundane ever since. 
She found a loose thread inside her and has been pulling ever since. 

These pieces depict the parallel lives I wish to live through other people. A photograph is a facade, a projection one's self into another visage. The photo of the children on their scooters was taken in Shanghai and is a reminder of a youth she could have had if her parents had stayed. The facades of the elderly Chinese people in Chinatown gesture towards how she flattens her identity. 



*One must imagine Sisyphus happy. *
At an exhibit like this, truthfully, more than watching the art i enjoy watching people watching the art: their heads craned to squint at the skylight, their hands pointing at the different exhibits.

This exhibit represents the spaces between selves—how photographs help us experience parallel lives through the lens pointed at another. A photograph is a facade, a projection one's self into another visage. 

There's this word called _sonder_—the realization that each passerby lives a life as complex as your own—where we can find both our deepest isolation and our most profound connection. In 2023 I spent the year "looking for myself" around Europe and Asia. It's the year i felt simultaneously the loneliest and most interconnected. 

These pieces depict the parallel lives I wish to live through other people, to understand these strangers who I recognized as mirrors to myself. Pictures in the middle depict an inner desire to connect with my heritage. Taken on photowalks through Chinatown and a visit back to Shanghai, they feature the youth and elderly as a reflection on youth and a precursor to wisdom. The black-and-white photos depict the day-to-day ennui and urban chaos—the repetitive rhythm of commuters, the blur of anonymous faces, the feeling of being swept along in a current you can't control. There's something both liberating and suffocating about disappearing into the crowd.

To take a photo demands presence, but at the same time, separates you from the scene. 

In 2023, I traveled alone through Europe and Asia with my camera. I was lonelier than I'd ever been, but also felt more connected to strangers than ever before. These photos were taken as a way to understand these strangers who I recognized as mirrors to myself. The photos in the middle encompass a desire to connect with my heritage and inner youth, bookended by urban chaos .




In moments of urban hustle and the hedonic treadmill, there's this feeling of total freedom. in moments of cultural glory, i feel strangely separated from my roots. 

如鱼离水 (rú yú lí shuǐ) translates to *like a fish separated from water* and represents the feeling of feeling out of place.
on the outside, i am desperately searching for my place within an ever-moving society. the endless corporate crawl. 
is a depiction of my efforts to find my identity through travel - and how they end up as lossy flattened images. 
to exist in a crowd of people is a continual negotiation of self. my favorite part of the guggenheim wasn’t the art — it was watching people watch the art, their heads craned to squint at the skylight, their hands pointing at the different exhibits. there’s that word, sonder, to describe the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own. i adore the street camera’s ability to peel back a stranger’s layers and project a story.

key takeaways:
- planned maintenance for oai is such a n of 1 experience
	- rarely is a customer running a tightly coupled workload that is also such as massive spread
- traditional hpc ppl dgaf about cloud 
- cloud originally sold to hpc as being good for hpc, pre it actually being good

simulation sciennce
san diego

university supercomputers -> corporate
doesnt wanna do anythingabout computer
j getting jobdone

easy to lose sight fo computer pov
atypical microsoft customer
internal ppl 

commercial hpc vs academic hpc
they dont care about tech
help federal business
traditional on prme
anti cloud
they dont care about cloud
cloud started non hpc
no gpus in azure 15 years ago
cloud was irrelevant 
no infiniband
small scale stuff

intro to cloud
only within 

we did hpc before
firstinfniband was 10 years ago
customer narrative - we use hpc to design data center and xbox chips
some 


what we do for oai is doing custom stuff
turn it into a product
problems we have is azure built for not hpc
single vm
trad azure thing
taking cluster 1


how r u takinglearning for biggest supercomputer

level of abstraction 
finest grain thing u want to run is a vm
fault tolerance just dploymulti vms
everything is a sinlge point of failure

microsoft ai doesnt care aout infra
common pattern in hpc to have all telemetry
nevr do anything

if something 
as long as u can point them to problem
day planned maintenance
take note of what roll back
most hpc is mission critical

inferencing side
attitude is diff
if things break
issue w training
is massive scale

missioncritical

trainingis tightly coupled

supercomputes are 1/9s
3/9s

see if we can
