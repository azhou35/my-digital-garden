examples of me working w data:
- decrease in ppl using azure batch , spike in certain gpu skus
> - cyclecloud - working on data fix 
- nodes-in-service data for oai 
- working to get data of usage of life sciences users on batch and identified where the dropoffs where to build copilot solution
	- identifying theres friction point maybe in the data or support tickets
- when have i used sql 
	- to determine the trend in batch users per genomics customers over time
	- specific accounts gpu utilization rates
- diff stategies for batch given competition 

While working with Microsoft Azure's Batch service, I identified a significant opportunity for improvement by analyzing usage data for our life sciences customers. Through SQL queries examining batch utilization trends over time, I discovered concerning drop-off points in the genomics workflow that were causing friction for these specialized users.
To measure success, I established clear KPIs:

- Reduction in workflow abandonment rates at previously identified friction points
- Increase in end-to-end completion of genomics pipelines
- Growth in GPU utilization rates for targeted customer accounts
- Decrease in support tickets related to workflow configuration issues

I dug deeper into the data, examining specific account GPU utilization rates and correlating them with support ticket patterns. The analysis revealed that life sciences customers were encountering technical barriers at specific stages of their genomics pipelines, particularly when scaling computational resources for sequence alignment and variant calling processes. Based on this data-driven insight, I proposed developing a targeted Copilot solution specifically designed to simplify these friction points. My proposal included comprehensive metrics showing where users were abandoning workflows and quantified the potential impact on customer retention and resource utilization. To measure success, I established clear KPIs:

- Reduction in workflow abandonment rates at previously identified friction points
- Increase in end-to-end completion of genomics pipelines
- Growth in GPU utilization rates for targeted customer accounts
- Decrease in support tickets related to workflow configuration issues

After implementing the Copilot solution, we tracked these metrics over a three-month period. The results were compelling: we saw a 32% reduction in workflow abandonment, 28% increase in pipeline completions, and a 17% growth in GPU utilization among life sciences customers. Support tickets for configuration issues decreased by 40%. This project demonstrated how targeted data analysis could uncover specific user pain points and drive meaningful product improvements. By understanding the unique needs of our life sciences customers through their usage patterns, we were able to develop a solution that significantly enhanced their experience and improved our business metrics.

Annie would be a great fit for the Product Ops Specialist role at Ramp, given her unique blend of developer-facing expertise and product management experience. At Microsoft, she spearheads the operational excellence of high-performance computing infrastructure, building SQL-based dashboards that surface insights on usage by their top AI customers while reducing operational spending on GPUs.

In her previous role at AWS, she worked closely with the game developer community, triaging technical issues behind SDK integrations and producing documentation geared for a seamless customer experience.

Her experience at an early-stage legal tech startup has proven her ability to work in undefined spaces, translating customer feedback into product improvements through cross-functional collaboration. Annie is eager to join Ramp to drive immediate impact for business-critical needs.
