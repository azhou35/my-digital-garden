Hey Bookbear buddies! Thanks for coming out to the Bookbear meetup yesterday -- we hope everyone soaked in some sun, got a chance to chat with Ava, and made a new friend! 

For some photos from the picnic, check out this [Google Photos album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ogqkdbeEX2imCSPj6). Feel free to add pictures if you have any 😊

We would love to hear more about your time at the event -- please fill out this quick survey, especially if you're interested in future bookbear & writing themed hangs! 

Happy autumn and we're excited to gather everyone together soon :) 

Cheers,
Justin & Annie
