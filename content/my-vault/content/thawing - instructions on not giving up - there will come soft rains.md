**thoughts on sensivity, resilience**
hibernation

hey stranger, 

notes on sensitivity

at work my manager calls me sensitive. i insist i'm not sensitive and teers pool in my eyes. 
the leaves form a second skin. 



**sense & sensibility**

i believe to read into poetry you must be highly attuned to your senses - whether that manifests through *sensitivity* or *sensibility* is up to you. 

"This awe made him feel good, still permeable to wonder, but also shamefully provincial. Country mouse."
- Kaveh Akbar, Martyr! 

There are moments in Manhattan when I am overwhelmed with joy at my surroundings. Walking through Tompkins Square Park with the leaves kaleidoscoping across my vision. Running down BPC and catching my breath when the city skyline unfolds itself before me. 

But there are also moments where the skyscrapers have blended into a wash of sameness and the tedium of the commute to work drills into the back of your eyeballs. The repetition of life has made me haggard and cold. 

to be a writer is to have a high permeability to wonder. to have a high permeability is to be sensitive to your environment. 

i want to stay tender, soft & true. but i want to survive in this vulnerable stillness - to be like the flowers who bloom again after indestructible winter. even the flowers cry in the face of darkness - dew collects on their cheek. 

spring is light within the fog, hope after the path of no return. it's dawn after twilight. 
im trying to be more resilient. i want to envelop myself in layers of self-truths, to tunnel into my interiority and enact my full potential. 

i want to stay tender, soft & true. but i want to survive in this vulnerable stillness - to be like the flowers who bloom again after indestructible winter. even the flowers cry in the face of darkness - dew collects on their cheek. 

in periods of steady rain, i want to dance.

There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn 
Would scarcely know that we were gone

at the end of the world, i want to keep dancing. “**And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.**

you smell of summer - but you feel like spring.
