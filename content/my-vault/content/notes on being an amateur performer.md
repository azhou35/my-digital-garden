*to do things for the love of it.*
notes on being an amateur
- watching amateur friends perform in teh city is so cool and fulfilling
- everyones very engaged in their craft
- open mics
- the joy of an open mic 
- enabling amateurs to legitimatize themseves
- my fav part is going to these open mics and taking pics 
- asking about their process of "putting urself out there"
- its electric
- you see people meld into a persona
- my form of art has never been performance - based -- i get incredible stage fright
