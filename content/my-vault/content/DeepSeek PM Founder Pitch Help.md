title: "DeepSeek PM Founder Pitch Help"
---

Here's how to position yourself with curiosity and technical depth, tailored to your background and the startup ecosystem's needs:

---

### **1. "I want to pitch you on a role:**  
**"I want to pitch you on a role where I can help your portfolio companies operationalize their AI/ML infrastructure to scale LLMs cost-effectively while delivering measurable user value.**  
My work optimizing GPU performance for OpenAI’s supercomputing partnership involved solving latency, utilization, and cost challenges at the bleeding edge of infrastructure. Startups today face similar bottlenecks as they transition from prototypes to production-grade systems. I’ve done this in both scrappy environments (e.g., as the first PM at a legal tech startup) and with Azure’s AI drug discovery partners. Let’s talk about how I can help your teams balance technical constraints with product outcomes as they scale."  

---

### **2. "I want to join your team as a:**  
**"I want to join your team as a Technical PM or Founding PM focused on AI/ML Infrastructure, bridging the gap between complex systems and user-centric outcomes.**  
My sweet spot is translating infrastructure optimizations (like GPU efficiency or distributed training) into tangible business metrics—reducing inference costs, accelerating iteration cycles, or unlocking new use cases. At my current role, I’ve worked directly with engineering teams to define and meet SLAs for AI workloads, and at a legal tech startup, I built product processes from zero. If you’re building tools to democratize LLM scalability for enterprises or rethinking the data stack for generative AI, let’s connect."

### **3. "I want to learn more about how X is doing Y to accomplish Z."**  
Lean into your niche expertise while showing openness to new approaches:  
- **For infrastructure startups:**  
  *“I want to learn more about how your team is optimizing model inference costs without sacrificing latency. Are you experimenting with hybrid quantization strategies or novel hardware orchestration?”*  
- **For applied AI startups:**  
  *“How are you designing your ML pipelines to balance rapid iteration (e.g., fine-tuning for niche use cases) with scalability? Are you leaning on open-source frameworks or building proprietary tooling?”*  
- **For enterprise-focused tools:**  
  *“How are you structuring data pipelines to handle dynamic compliance requirements in industries like healthcare or legal, where LLMs face high scrutiny?”*  

---

### **Why this works:**  
- **Specificity + Relevance:** Directly ties your GPU/LLM scaling experience to startups’ biggest pain points (cost, latency, compliance).  
- **Credibility:** Highlights your dual background in early-stage startups and large-scale partnerships (OpenAI, Azure).  
- **Curiosity:** Asks technical questions that signal you’ve "been in the trenches" while inviting deeper dialogue.  
- **Outcome focus:** Connects infrastructure work to business results (e.g., "unlocking new use cases"), which resonates with founders and VCs.  

Tailor the examples to the specific startup/VС’s focus area (e.g., mention compliance frameworks for healthcare investors or quantization techniques for infra builders).
Perfect! Let’s weave in your interest in “cool AI” (generative AI, novel applications, bleeding-edge use cases) while keeping your positioning grounded in your technical PM expertise. Here’s how to refine your messaging to resonate with founders and VCs working on innovative, experimental, or unconventional AI:

---

### **1. "I want to pitch you on a role:**  
**"I want to pitch you on a role where I can help build the next generation of ‘cool AI’—whether that’s generative models, multi-modal systems, or experimental applications—by solving the infrastructure and product challenges that turn prototypes into scalable, user-loved products.**  
My background spans optimizing GPU clusters for massive LLMs (like OpenAI’s supercomputing partnership) *and* designing early-stage AI products (e.g., legal tech pre-LLM boom). I’m obsessed with how teams operationalize cutting-edge research—like reducing inference costs for real-time generative AI or designing feedback loops for AI that evolves with user behavior. If you’re pushing boundaries in creative industries, gaming, synthetic media, or AI-native consumer apps, let’s talk about making your technical ambitions sustainable and user-centric."  

---

### **2. "I want to join your team as a:**  
**"I want to join your team as a Technical PM or Founding PM for ‘cool AI’ products—generative AI, agentic systems, or novel applications—where infrastructure scalability meets bold user experiences.**  
I thrive in environments where AI isn’t just a feature but the core product. For example:  
- Optimizing inference pipelines for real-time generative AI (e.g., video, music, or interactive storytelling).  
- Designing data flywheels for AI that learns from user interactions (e.g., gaming NPCs, personalized creative tools).  
- Balancing model experimentation (e.g., fine-tuning, RAG hybrids) with production-grade reliability.  
If you’re building AI that surprises and delights users while tackling hard technical problems under the hood, let’s connect."

### **3. "I want to learn more about how X is doing Y to accomplish Z."**  
**For generative AI/creative tools:**  
- *“How are you handling the cold-start problem for personalized generative AI (e.g., user-specific avatars or workflows) without overwhelming GPU budgets?”*  
- *“Are you using smaller, specialized models for specific creative tasks (e.g., texture generation, dialogue) instead of relying solely on massive LLMs? How do you orchestrate them?”*  

**For AI-native consumer apps:**  
- *“How are you designing feedback loops to keep users engaged with AI outputs that feel dynamic and evolving (e.g., AI companions, gamified experiences)?”*  
- *“What’s your strategy for mitigating API costs as you scale generative features—are you moving to open-source models, hybrid architectures, or edge computing?”*  

**For experimental/agentic AI:**  
- *“How are you testing and validating ‘emergent’ AI behaviors in agentic systems before deployment? Are you using simulation environments or human-in-the-loop guardrails?”*  
- *“What’s your approach to maintaining low-latency performance for AI agents that require real-time context (e.g., gaming, live customer support)?”*  

**For all “cool AI” startups:**  
- *“How are you measuring success beyond traditional metrics—e.g., user delight, novelty, or virality—while still ensuring technical scalability?”*  

---

### **Why this works for “cool AI”:**  
- **Bridges infrastructure and creativity:** Positions you as someone who can handle the technical grit (GPU optimization, distributed systems) *and* the product vision required for experimental AI.  
- **Focus on scalability:** Even “cool” AI needs to be cost-effective and reliable—your experience with OpenAI-scale systems shows you can help startups avoid technical debt as they grow.  
- **Curiosity about the edge cases:** Questions about cold-start problems, hybrid architectures, and emergent behaviors signal you’re thinking deeply about the challenges unique to innovative AI.  
- **User-centric angle:** Startups in creative/experimental AI often struggle to balance “wow factor” with practical utility—your legal tech and healthcare experience show you can anchor novelty in real-world value.

### **Final polish:**  
Add a hook to your intro when networking:  
*“I’m currently working on AI infrastructure for large-scale LLMs, but I’m obsessed with what’s next—whether that’s AI reshaping creative industries, redefining human-AI collaboration, or making ‘magical’ user experiences scalable. What’s the most exciting technical or product challenge your team is tackling right now?”*  

This keeps the conversation open-ended while anchoring your expertise in the minds of founders and investors. 🚀
