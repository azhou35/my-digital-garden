	4. what are the key indiciators u have been tracking to make sure the chip performance meets market needs
	5. **How do you think about competing with NVIDIA's ecosystem** vs. creating a new category? ie, if the transformer bet works out, what moat is there against their internal teams replicating the same efforts?
**execution & unknowns**
3. what are the known unknnowns u have today 
4. **What surprised you most** about going from design to actual deployment/operations

gtm - 
what deployments look like on gtm
now they have questions
how do u actually get this into the data center
scratch = everything has happy 
please the customer
sold a bunch of racks to diff clouds
make sure the instillation work successfully
dont drive the rack into the data center
data pipeline
master list
and how many racks
and skus
when racks need to go to customer
crm
erp 
not has decided who what go
