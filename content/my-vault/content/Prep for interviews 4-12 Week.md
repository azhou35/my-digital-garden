### Tell me about yourself.
My story starts in Central Jersey. Growing up i went to an engineering high school, but I was always the one interested in a mixture of the technical and humanities. I did a bunch of bio research into vaccine development, actually optimizing the cold chain, and even wanted to go into bioinformatics at first. But what I really was my passion has always been trying to ingest complexity and dive into the messiest problems and use quantitiative tools to tackle human problems.

This led me to data science at Cornell, got involved in our VC club where I learned to use this skills for startups.  I was alwyas drawn to open ended nature of startups and the problems they tackle. Since college I've done a couple things w that ecosystem - one thing is in my free time I write research briefs for Contrary. And at work, I built a business case for partnering with life sciences startups in AI Drug discovery. 

Strategy really clicks for me. The bulk of my job is very adaptable - Its not a typical PM job and thats what drawn me to microsoft. sometimes im building data dashboards then the next day I'm prototyping these multi-agent AI systems for genomics researchers.

One of the coolest projects I got to work on was mapping out the business plan for our life sciences vertical - basically figuring out how these AI drug discovery startups need compute and what that market opportunity could look like. Chatted with our in-house pharmacy experts, worked with business development to draw an action plan, and interviewed these startups on their workflows. That strategic stuff really clicked for me.

I really love that messy middle ground where you're figuring out what customers actually need and how to scale it. So I'm looking forward to opportunities that allow me to stay close to the customer and drive impact in the areas that matter.
