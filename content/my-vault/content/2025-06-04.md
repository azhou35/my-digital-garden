damian meeting:
* scale down budget 

Scale is my top option as a company but i'm a little torn right now given the gap in compensation
and i would sign immediately if that gap was bridged

readiness for scale call:
* etched 
	* 148,900 base
	* 20k sign on
	* and equity
* earliest to leave - week of june 30th 
* shares out of the esop
	* still negotiating that
	* initially came to me w in the range of 10 bips but i thought it was a bit low
	* so they said they would go back and see
	* i still wanna negotiate it but that was the initial offer
* sign on bonus since im leaving 30k on the table leaving before september

"What I currently have on the table"

"Hey I dont want to negotiate live on the phone. Scale is my top option. I love John, I want to work with John. But I want to make the best decision."

I dont want to drag this out, but if you can let me konw whats the best Scale can do,  I can get you an answer tomrorw

"I need this on paper"
ask mahesh if he got options or equity


what can change is sign on bonus + base
if they match ur base
