title: "home cafe"
---

for my 23rd birthday this year i set up my own cafe. 
there's been demand to cultivate our own home cafe in our own spaces. where is this demand coming from? 

we crave ambient co-presence, we crave the ability to work on our own projects in the comfort of others. 

in copenhagen i did a project on cafe that was titled: cafes, community, and coziness of copenhagen cafes.
