recording conversations w her husband as part of her writing process
so many ai wearables
i confess - i am at mercy of these ai recordings
when i ask my mom questions in chinese i wish i had it on voice camera so i could remember
what is memory? -> human memory is infalible, whereas machine memory is exact but missing context 
when you ask two people to remember the same event they will remember it differently - subjective interpretations
