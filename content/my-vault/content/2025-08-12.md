i've stopped watching movies on plans

agents are bounded by unsustainable economies of multi turn conversations
many enterprises are not ready 
AI to predict customer behaviors and needs, and understand emotions
AI initiatives stall after POC phase

- reimagining workflows from ground up w agents at the core 
- human: 
	- earning trust, driving adoption, governance to manage agent autonomy and prevent uncontrolled sprawl
- AI agents interpret high level goals and deermine necessary steps to achieve them 
- If customer reports a billing issue: agentic AI system can analyze the account, identify discrepencies, apply corrections, noify customer
- Handle specialized functions of scheduling, technical support
- Ai-Powered self service 
	- static FAQ -> dynamic AI -driven experiences
	- proactively analyze cusotmer interactions across calls and emails to idnetify aemerging issues and knowledge gaps
- IVR - AI will provide real time suggestions and summarize past conversatoins 
long term there is a need to reinvent the customer call workflow
- ge ai tools are enough to reduce 10% to embed within a legacy process without redesign 
	- generating content, executing predefined steps
	- process itself is sequential, rule bound, shaped by human constraints
	- how do you rearchitecture the entire task flow from ground up? 
		- design the process to fully exploit strength of agentic ai: 
		- parallel execution to collapse cycle time, real time adaptability, deep personalization, elastic capacity that flexes instantly w demand 
	- e.g. hpotheticalcall center could imrpove speed but human agents need to manage every step
		- agents can autonomously resolve frequent, low complexity issues
	- how do you reimagine a call centers process around agent aonotnmy
		- AI agents don’t just respond—they proactively detect common customer issues (such as delayed shipments, failed payments, or service outages) by monitoring patterns across channels, anticipate likely needs, initiate resolution steps automatically (such as issuing refunds, reordering items, or updating account details
		- communicate directly w chat 
		- human gents are repositioned as escalation managers who only come in when agents detect exceptions to typicla patterns

			- reduction in time to resolution of 60 - 90% 
		- agents introduce new risks:
			- uncontrolled autnonmy, fragmented system access, lack of observability and traceability, agent sprawl
models behind agents:
- low latency inference for real time responsiveness:
	- subsecond response times w predictable latency, even under compute constraints
	- fine-tuning and controllability - fine tuned, grounded in enterprise knowledge
- lightweight development 
- scalable multi agent orchestration 
currently APIs are the primary interface between agent and system
- how can u reimagine it architecture around agent-first model, for user interfaces/logic and data access are designed for machine interaction (machine-reable interfaces instead of human cree s)

human questions
- human-agent cohabitation
- autonomy control

pricing:
- openai does resource based pricing 
- agentforce does conversation based pricing - good for bursts, but not good for continuous high volume scenario
- labor replacement pricing - fee relative to work its replacing 
- outcome-based pricing 

memory: 
- store data into a vector data base to get chunks quickly - agent a working memory to lower token costs 
- user profile storage 

metrics to track:
- accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score to measure correctness 
- for ranking tasks, use metrics like mean average precision time 
- resource metrics - memory cpu and energy 
- human in th eloop evaluation checks an agetn by letting real ppl judge its outoput and behavior 

risks:
- if only 2 months what would you cut - 
	- focus on tier 1 queries 
- measure success
	- the milestones are important
