9/20-9/22 the best weekend of my life
开心
“in high spirits” maybe (what with that open heart)
it feels like energy

what is happy? 

last year i chose copenhagen -- among many reasons -- to find what the secret of happiness is. there must be something in the water, something in the design, something in the food? i didn't find it. i felt like we had lowered our standards for what life could be -- we couldn't sting our tongue without spice, we couldn't aggrandize the eyes without unique building designs, we couldn't run into conflicts with a homogenized population. it felt like less like a cultural exploration and more like a neutered utopia, where everything was too perfect to feel true happiness. 

im someone who can pendulum betwween really high high sand quite low lows. in an attempt to emotionally regulate i've been fearful of happiness, because of the crash that would happen afterwards.

there was a lot of enjoyment, 
i think i have been feeling content. 

i took e for the first time. i didn't know what to expect, and i took it with no fear nor expecttions. 

N and i started dating. it was something that felt not like a choice but a feeling. for once i don't enter thinking about the end or the amount of hurt we can inflict upon each other. there's something intensely diferent with him. something that goes like: i can continue to explore the capacity at which i love without fear that one of us will outweigh the other. 

in middle school my friend had a theory called the inverse theory: that for every crush you have, they will like you back an amount inverse to your's. essentially, for two people, you will either have person a like a lot and person b like a little -- person a like a little and person b a lot -- or the equilibrium case, which is each person likes each other very little, so the differential between the two is marginal.

though this was the musing of a yearning child, it somehow became the framework i saw many of my relationships. with N i'm starting to believe there's a partner where all the love you pour into someone is reflected back into someone. 

开心

开心 (開心) kāixīn  - “to feel happy, to have a good time, be delighted,” so it feels like more energy, “in high spirits” maybe (what with that open heart), 
--> kai xin is what i felt this weekend - literally opening my heart to greater heights of emotion i didn't know was possible before!

快乐


快乐 (快樂) kuàilè - “happy, joyful, cheerful.” to me this feels like a very… innocent happy, it’s the “happy” in “happy birthday” y'know? I probably wouldn’t say like “today I’m really 快乐,” (I mean maybe) but stuff like “a bird is 快乐地唱歌.”
innocent happy is def what i felt w eric -- the feeling this could be something good. but innocent.

高兴 (高興) gāoxìng - “happy, glad, in a cheerful mood” this is a more everyday kind of happy to me. It can also mean “be willing to, be happy to,” like “她是高兴看电影.”

幸福

幸福 (幸福) xìngfú - “happiness, happy, blessed.” so more seriousish. It can be more literary, you have a happy life “幸福生活,” or happy memories. If you use it in saying like “a happy family” or you “感到幸福” it’s more about feeling fortunate-happy not just everyone is cheerful.   

愉快 yúkuài - “happy, pleasant, cheerful.” this is pretty similar to kuàilè, and I actually almost never hear it so I don’t have a great grasp of its nuances. But maybe that alone says it’s not like a go-to choice. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
