title: "why do i dream of old friends"
---

the closer i get to my return home the more i think of my old friends
how deeply i felt to be in their orbit
i acknowledge i grew up w a deep insecurity complex, always comparing myself w angela, always comparing myself w mary
-- these are wounds i cannot obfuscate 
i think i dreamed about mary and nia yday. 
my dreams are composed of people from all over my life
