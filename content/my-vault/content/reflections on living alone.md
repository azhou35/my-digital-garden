[[reflections on living alone]]
* double edged sword -- forces me into focus time and focus on my hobbies, as opposed to hanging out w my friend
	* but also forces me to seek post-work social activities to fill myself w the passive socialization i need to survive as an extrovert
	* which is better? theyre just different
* tbh its a really good thing
	* forces me to break out of easy strong ties
	* and lesson from jeffrey sun -- if you want to lock into creative work, you need to have your focus time outside of work 
	* in my rooming situations im always v tempted to hang out vs reading a book
* i think my goal is to make sure i use my spare time wisely 
* maybe i will move in oct 

goals for new roomie:
1. baseline -- has to afford rent LOL
