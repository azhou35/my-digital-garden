> “I’ve spent the last two years orchestrating supercomputing workloads at scale—building the operational backbone for some of the most compute-intensive AI training jobs in the world. Before that, I worked in data science, and now I’m excited to apply that rigor to domains like systematic investing, where insight, infrastructure, and iteration speed matter just as much.”
> I've been working in big tech for a bit but I want to find a place that helps me consistently hone my technical skills and drive some impact. I'm new to the finance world
