title: "01.14.25 thought dump"
---

booked ticket back home to see mom in hospital - because of two undiagnosed kidney stones / gallbladder stones
i understand why people dislike this commute - stalks of oatmeal yellow trees 
**nj transit thoughts**
*commute*
* very few people are lucky to live right next to a time machine
* winter sun, blinding the dead trees, casting harsh shadows against abandoned junkyards
* the gap between new jersey and new york is so wide 
* parking lots, amazon delivery warehouses 
* grafitti
* uneven fences 
* khalid in my earbuds 
* every time i think of growing up my stomach churns 
* there is no one writing love songs about new jersey
* this was a place that i felt unspecial
bahar & i reflecting: growing up in unspecial places really forces you to squeeze magic and meaning out of anywhere
imagination / creativity
