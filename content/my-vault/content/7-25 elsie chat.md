- background supporting research workloads with our supercomputers 
- rlly keen on quantitative and qualitative research and how to go deep 
	- as well as build tools to solve pressing problems for researchers
	- 
- pms in vertical vs general enterprise
- who are ur users, what r ur metrics, internal tooling 
- would love to know how product strategy unfolds at 2 sigma
	- whether internal tools where your customers are the traders bringing in revenue 
	- or external platforms like venn 
	- how tight is the pm <> dev integration 
- balance between adopting new tech vs compliance
	- esp w copilots and agents how does the vetting process work 
		- at microsft ive seen a lot of financial institutions like banks highly protective of proprietary data which im sure is moreso the case here 
	- influence the decision to build/buy 

talking points about microsoft:
> “ I’'ve been a TPM at Microsoft AI Infra where I'm driving supercomputing infra for OpenAI’s training and inference workloads — managing reliability, orchestration, and software-driven ops for 5K+ H100/H200 GPUs. Also worked across finance and healthcare enterprises on their workload scheduler strategy. That’s given me deep exposure to how AI infrastructure operates at scale, but also how brittle and complex it is today. I've always found my strength in bridging the technical and the nontechnical, and I love working directly with the customer,  from building dashboards and automations to shipping multi-agent Copilot architectures based on genomics use cases.

alpha:
- bull on coreweave 
- honestly two things here
	- our infra is a bit trapped by our partnership w oai 
	- second, coreweave is cloud purpose built for ai workloads
	- how ai works at scale breaks conventional cloud 
	-
