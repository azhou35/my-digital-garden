would i move for fireworks fdpm  
or am i ok staying in sieraa ai strategist
one is more azure saas platform
still very different than a pm role 

in the event i take fireworks fdpm  - would i have any regrets? 
me and nitins relationsihp may be destroyed 

if its openai - i say yes
and i grind for a year or have my pick of startups in the valley 

Mahesh would be just as excited to work at a good applied ai startup than an infra 
its not necessarily inherently better 

Good c

Framework should be good companies where you believe in the people and the product and the opportunity and theyll teach you things.

pros / cons
fireworks as an opportunity is pretty unique 
- they treat it as a mentorship opportunity where i address some high level onboarding details 
- work specifically with startups
- am i specfically enthralled by ai infra or is it just because its there and my background 
- i actually may not enjoy talking to researchers compared to real people using agent workflows 

its not worth moving if you're miserable
user-facing pm job being about metrics is also be important
visualizing what life is like in a specific role and reconciling with its desires
are you excited by the problems fireworks is solving?
- well its all jargon to me 
- its like how can we make open source actualy usable

SIerra

vs




Fireworks

its a full product role fit

at this current moment i cant summon the intense conviction i need to jump

i am excited by the inference opportunity
but i dont nerd out or obsess over it 


how much you look at ai roles in nyc, 
including applied ai roles and no-pm roles

mahesh prices my nyc life + relationship very highly

what motivates me?
- coworkers, prestige, learning 

in my eyes sierra has more prestige than fireworks
fireworks may be more intellectually interesting
but i never got a strict conviction in this is an elegant solution that our product solves
but also i am circulating around the issue
if the founder
it doesnt matter what scope the role says 
i can just do my own thing at a startup


my dad wants me to move
my dad/justin think i should move

mahesh prices nyc and happy life very highly 
and happy relationshio


Nitin is very firmly against sf
- would nitin ever move to sf 


exhaustive list of nyc:
- david ai 
- sierra
	- can i pivot into pm in the future there? 
- graphite 
- Lithic PM
- pinecone AI PM


Mahesh is offering me a path i wish to be true:
- u can be super successful in nyc anyways

 RWC it feels like success is untapped

do you actually care about ai infra this much?
- well its your day job isnt it? 

everyone moment when i choose nyc i have to make the most of it 
i feel like i dont make the most of nyc right now

at the end of the day its my career 



how good is this fireworks opportunity actually?
- webiste is just ok 
- their numbers / ARR is good 
- mainly driven by one customer
- its a pricing situation 
- its very early 
- but also im pm #4 (early PM) 
- <170 ppl 
- lots of surface area to growth 

would i take openai?
- yes 


pm @ ai startup is the goal 
- fireworks makes it the next step 
- sierra makes it one step back, for potential of two steps forward

what is the kind of product i enjoy:
- some sort of b2b startup within a vertical or touches many verticals
- theres something visual that you are working with 
- there is some polish / taste involved 

fireworks sort of feels like a chinese company 
- do i wanna work on a researcher heavy chinese startup
- or something with more plish and taste at the start 
- is sf really that bad
- very much carried by cursor revenue 
- tighter exposure to the founders - you work directly with the c suite
	- ray went from 1st PM -> director of PM in 2 years 
	- much closer to the PM / process
- fireworks feels like a more guaranteed rocket ship
	- its a pm job right in font of me 


would i get as good of a career boost being a pm at firreworks vs strategist at sierrra 
i have to be ok with 




rationally i will say the idea of never moving to sf ever does kind of freak me out 

does it make sense to get off of the PM track to become a "sstrategist" 

what are the chances fireworks is a generational outcome? unlikely to tell 

when a startup is less structured/more new you have more chance to influence
but also i think i need some direction bc i ahvnet rlly workd in workplace

Sierra 
- double in size - 330 
- agent development - could be more technical
