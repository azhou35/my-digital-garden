title: "what are you running from"
---

my mentor in work gave me solid advice: dont just run from your company to a worse situation just because you're unhappy 
i run best 

tik tok does a good job of finding a new thing to make girls insecure about, and the topic for this week is cortisol. people my age shill powders designed to reduce your cortisol and solve all the problems that plague modern girl hood -- your belly pooch, fatigue, stomach problems.
i'm a fidgety person, the type of classmate who's shaking their feet, tapping their fingers, 
to stretch a metaphor, i'm prone to thinking about several things in parallel, which is something interesting, but usually prone to combustion. 

my tendency to move fast is my biggest strength and curse: i'm efficient. i like to optimize and multitask, squeeze the most out of every part of my day. on the other hand, i'm impatient. careless, at worst. 

sometimes in my worst bouts of overthinking, it feels like my thoughts are stuck in a hamster wheel loop in my head -- constantly churning, cycling, cooking for nothing in particular. 

moving from one life stage to another, i expect to go further in distance. looking forward, the scary thing is that my next stage in life may not be directly further. it could be parallel , a pivot, even walking backwards.

but the thing I love about running on the streets 

transparently, i question if i had ran *too* fast in my previous years. speed-running my degree -- could i have developed more technical classes, taken harder classes, stayed longer in my classes?

since january, i've started most days with a run. this doesn't come from any inherent athlecism --

## a case for the aimless wander
on rare days, i force myself to take a walk.
