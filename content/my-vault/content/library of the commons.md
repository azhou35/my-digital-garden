hypothesis: we have a collective knowledge within our inner networks that reflects our interests/backgrounds. our book collections are a reflection of our attention mechanisms. there is a higher chance of liking a book recommended by a friend/second-degree connection than goodreads. 

  - Your name
  - Book title + author
  - Photo of the cover
  - One line: pick one prompt and stick to it:
      - “Read this if you need ___.”
      - “This book changed my mind about ___.”
      - “Best read when you’re feeling ___.”

  Swap mechanic (no awkwardness)

  - After browsing, place your token on the book you want.


  The micro-infrastructure part (so it doesn’t end as an event)

  - Add one optional field: “If you take this, text me one sentence after you
    finish.”
  - After the cafe, publish the “catalog” as a single page or Are.na channel for
    the group.

  Reply with:

  - Gift swap or lending library
  - Public or private catalog
  - Whether you want this to feel intimate (names attached) or anonymized (just
    initials)
