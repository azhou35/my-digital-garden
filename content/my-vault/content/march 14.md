Today seemed like a core memory day.
Sat down and looked thru everyones LinkedIn profiles I admire. Realized I do like startups & investing in companies. 
And met some many creatives in verci. Man I wanna be there man.

Tips for VERCI app: 
* why verci?
  * story: traveling for 9 months , where ive been writing/taking pictures/filming. even tho my new job is in Seattle I moved to nyc bc I want to take my life as a creative seriously and meet other ppl  
* want to cultivate a creative 5-9 to fight burnout from my 9-5.  creatives feed off of each others’ energies. *creative disciplines feed off of each other*. ambition feeds off each other. Ive been following very for a while and when I was talking to my friend Thomas yeumabout writing communities & content creators he plugged verci. 
* checked out the olive tree writing club and immediately found my ppl — chatted up nang, wrote substack , talked to ppl doing all sorts of things like zines and choose ur adventure novels, and grabbed pizza afterwards. Exactly the like hearted people ive been searching for , honestly all my life.
  * even the serendipity of how I found out olive tree writing club — these are the magical opportunities I can find thru the ppl I meet at very 
  * can’t help that this it the right place, right time, right people 
* what do u create? 
  * * story telling at the end of the day
  * started w poetry/technical writing, towards substack writing & photography -> videos / film making
    * support network as I venture into film making
    * goal is to document life in all its beauty & messiness 
    * my love for poetry bleeds into my visual and written work 
    * from photographer, doodler, writer, poet, curator — I’m a jack of all trades, master of none, & maybe that’s ok. Different mediums help me explore the same concept from different angles—universal truths on love, growing up, nostalgia, guilt, all dissected in some way
      * I think thats where VERCI community can come in, to help me hone my focus
      * so many things to explore: poetic tech, cinematic short form content
  * even my day2day, pm at Microsoft, heavily involved w startups and telling their story to the company 
* ppl, man
  * first recommended to me by Thomas, 
  * vibes exactly like one of my fav 3rd spaces In college, we called it ehub and its where ppl would be working on startups or hw or eating or literally yapping for hours. 
  * visited office for olive tree writing club 
    * after club e all got pizza
    * talked to James, mang, ibi

* **creatives feed off of each others’ energies**
  * even if not in the same discipline. I get so excited on calls with my friend from college, as we share whatever creative side quests we’ve embarked on. I text my friend about new photo series ideas and we send each other the pictures that hit hard. *  I want this energy real time, all the time, w the people at very !!
* **creative disciplines feed off of each other**
  * from photographer, doodler, writer, poet, curator — I’m a jack of all trades, master of none, & maybe that’s ok. Different mediums help me explore the same concept from different angles—universal truths on love, growing up, nostalgia, guilt, all dissected in some way. I see each different creative pursuit as different steps in a creative workflow where the end goal is to ponder some question: 
* . right now, I’m thinking about finding creative communities in nyc, and how I can find others to motivate me and work with. i’m going to try cinematic-style videos, because I react so strongly to them. 
End of next week — next steps
