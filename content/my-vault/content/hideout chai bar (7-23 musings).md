title: "hideout chai bar (7-23 musings)"
---

had the most wholesome experience
chatting w sabrina about her son going off to college
shes a librarian at albany uni

hmm how to say know / balance what to do 
resetting my gut & my life 
during run thoughts:
- i have 100% agency over my life yet i act as if i am stuck within this loop
- i am using complacency as an excuse to not take action 
- my friends can be put into three buckets:
	- shared air (we met in a highly immersive space, like cornell cmu study abroad etc)
		- goal: turn these group weak ties -> strong 1:1s 
	- dopamine (we all source dopamine from going out / raving / running)
		- goal: turn it from group weak ties -> strong 1:1s or group strong ties
	- navel gazing
		- insular shared activities (we do my hobbies together, aka overthinking/writing/intellectualizing photo walks)
		- goal: turn these strong 1:1s into a group tie 
- close ties: people who occupy both shared air AND dopamine/navel gazing


	- what am i passionate about? 
		- i am still in this lost state. going into nyc 5 months ago i had loose "aspirations" to be a "content creator" but honestly that doesnt feel right. not that i super tried. 
		- maybe i should just write / read more?
during bookbear date thoughts:
* he leads w ambition, says all of his friends are high iq 
	* what is high iq?
	* how would i define my values and taste?
	* he commented i ask a LOT of questions at first -> switches into equilibrium
		* him and joseph both observed that i tend to ask a lot of questions 
		* i wonder if my other friends think this 
		* ppl like when they get asked a lot of questions  
	* reminds me of joseph the way that he processes other people 
		* collecting data and then "reads" them to understand their motivations
		* joseph also asked its interesting how many questions you ask other people
		* i feel like him and joseph r on the same spectrum in terms of their interpretation of ppl
	* really uncomfy convo at first -- body language showed me he didnt rlly know how to compose himself in 1:1 convos
	* he rlly enjoys books and biographies about people
nitin going back:
* how do i feel? am i attached?
	* i think i am a bit emotionally attached / physically attached 
	* do i want to be in a relationship with him? i cant imagine meeting up w him more than one time a week 

interactions with twitter/startupy/buildy people
* similarities between joseph and glenn 
	* both REALLY intent on reading people but like over intellectualize it to the point that they're mute in group settings (joseph at picnic, glenn says he only likes 1:1s)
		* like joseph sending me a notion note on his thoughts on verci / spc people, glenn saying he reads people a lot (but im like why r u so hard to talk to rn?)
	* both were surprised by how many questions i asked them (and when i voiced surprise at their surprise they were i like it !!)
	* both are very upfront about their ambitions
		* glenn is like "i want to win" joseph is like "i want to be rich"
	* both seem to be drawn towards really intelligent ppl 
	* both negative rizz like glenn hadnt been in a date in 2 years
	* both talked to me about drugs / tripping (did shrooms w joseph and felt nothing)
	* both overall like a challenge to navigate the convo. like i think they have the ability to go super deep. but missing the casual bantery part of the convo that makes me feel comfy? i think from their pov i prob talk well to them more than the avg person but from my pov im not 100% comfy 
	* lol i feel like a hypocrite cuz i like to overanalyze ppl too. but idk im not like overcritical of normies?
		* like joseph's big struggle last time we talked is that he feels like he's the weirdest out of his normie nyc friends. glenn is also like self aware of how diff he is. 
	* both hella driven for something bigger than themselves
		* glenn w his company, joseph w religion / whatever weird consumer business hes running.
