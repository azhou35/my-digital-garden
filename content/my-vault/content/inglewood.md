title: "inglewood"

custom servicing
way we do sevicing is quite diff and labor intensive
ib team includes mihai + raj
mihai + raj report to saagar
understand servicing protocol
turned a cluster over DFW24
had a lot of ib sisues - a while to sort out
struggles to fix it
interconnects team outside of escalation group
dont have bandwidth to support that kind of care
dfw24

more general; I would like to understand

- what reasonable expectations are WRT speed of IB switch and/or link repairs
- if we have any SLAs in place around then
- what the barriers are to improving latency around these (which, anecdotally, seems to be in the 1-2 week range) got it, is this for inglewood or for other clusters?  all of the above? if inglewood is special I guess I'd like to understand in what ways, but my interest is broader than inglewood for sure

dont know enough about 
fleet servicing

no slas for fleet
focus on speed and effectiveness
not a sla per se

- Focus convo on fleet completely 
- and if they want an inglewood update - defer that 
- dont wanna lead with a description for inglewood 
- descibe what we're supposed to do for fleet 
- some gaps in one-off misses in recent deployment
- what's fleet sla 
- see if it's ok
- see if we can do an rca or improve

DFW24 is part of general fleet
- Amys / prabhat's team 
- We've been focusing on IW
- DFW is the same size
- came under the inference contract 
- being used for training
- want same level of service for dfw24
- drive rest of fleet forward fo what we
- prabhat's charter is to provide specialized services
- focused on inglewood
- focused on fairwater
- massive footprint for footpint
- not same requirements as training
- could parts of 
- when u do traing u cant do that 
- something for inference to training
