let me be clear - there are certain product managers who i aspire to be 
but i aspire to be pm because its a signal
do i actually want to be a pm? 

Bull Case for Sierra:
- i resonate with their core values of 
	- trust 
	- customer obsession
	- craftsmanshp + taste 
Bear Case for Sierra:



* look critically at your life's successes and your interests, discern what to prioritize
		- i enjoy looking at UIs and thinking thru user behavior of things 
* being aware of societal abstractions and what you're "supposed" to do in life affecting your choices

* that your current "vision" of a proper life might not be the actual best fit for you, precisely because of the above abstractions

the truth is - 
life has been on pause since recruiting and recruiting has been all consuming 

its a chicken and egg problem where i am waiting for life to start so i can do something and for my job to have more meaning 

dots only connect looking backwards

my big fear is if cat zhao/cat tang move to sf and join stratups nad i dont
their career is going to accelerate faster than mine

i want to be a tastemaker of ai product


building a durable brand

my concern is i have two dual intersts - 
deeply grounded in real life brand building and actual solutions 

also interested in the theroetical limits you push with ai infra

my prior is maybe im not as good at the latter but just by sheer research i have been interested in the latter

do i find solving customer service intellectually rewarding ? 

my bet so far is its hrad to find someone w domain experience and also young/hungry/scrappy, which is why ai infra seemed like an interesting problem to tackle. 

nitin is saying applied ai is a layer that sits atop everything.

the truth is i chose to stay in nyc for nitin 
not because i genuinely believe that ai stratgist at sierra is better than fireworks pm
