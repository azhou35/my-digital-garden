title: "on living authentically and ethically"
---

i am over-critical of people who do not have genuine interests
* kinda tired of this narrative that "i dont have real interests" or "i dont have hobbies"
	* a lot of people do things out of mimetic desire? they want to be the type of person with genuine interest so they will do these things but inauthentically
	* on the flipside people deep within their hobbies are deeply critical of yuppie culture -- almost overwhemingly so
	* im like in the middle i always feel like im in the middle
* i never quite fit in 
* i like how kristies mindset is: what sparks joy 
* and she also has an art background
i like how she has a lust for life
i realize i dont enjoy new grad yuppie culture
i miss youtube -- how we would niche into our own interets
tik tok is all about whats overall popular
* im so disillusioned b all these girls my age going to popups but then again it seems like they have fun so am i just a hater 
i guess the more i meeet ppl my age the more i feel like we are the same??
i get very easily bored by predictable conversation

* comment from N: my internal state really matches my external
* from Sam: she cares a lot about internal and external coherence
* example: continuity errors https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQH6CJ9nq4k 
	* details that violate the truth / framework we have given for someone
* i care so much about authenticity and that the *self* i present to the world is reflective of my internal self & identity

on living authentically:
i grew up a chameleon keen on changing shape: how id exaggerate my complaints with the girls by the lockers, how'd i beef up my bro-iness with the kids in the discord servers. in 3rd grade i said i wanted to be an actress, but it wasn't this kind of performer. 

it was in college when i realized how much of a lie i had built up. i had realized *all i wanted to be is to be seen* and that no one really knew me. 

i've realized that authenticity is one of my personal values. 

"Existential thinkers like Kierkegaard and Sartre wrote extensively about authenticity and what it meant to be authentic. For them, authenticity meant living the life we were meant to live, living it according to our values and purpose, not the values of someone else."

authenticity, as described in existentialism, is the "degree to which a person's actions are congruent with their with their values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity." a lack of authenticity is to act in *bad faith *with one's self.  

i think this is why i can't buy into communities that i don't really believe in (verci / church) and i'm not great and sustaining rituals. anything that feels contrary to my personal beliefs feels expendable. 

"Today's raw, unfiltered confession becomes tomorrow's cliché, forcing us to dig ever deeper, to expose ever more, in our quest to appear genuine. This escalation has led to a kind of authenticity inflation, where the value of sincerity is constantly being devalued. In this environment, even our most heartfelt moments can start to feel like just another transaction in the attention economy."

authenticity is deeply tied to intentionality with me. i want to choose what i consume.

i deleted tik tok. at some point the app was flooded with young yuppie new yorkers, whose profiles all matched mine eerily well -- semi-attractive asian girl who just moved to the city who's going to the latest restaurants. they dramatize their day in the lives, which usually features the same beauty shop pop-up in soho that's surely warranted a couple of hours standing in line. it was strange seeing my friends, acquaintances, mutual friends, all go to the same pop ups, wearing similar outfits. i go to the office and we all show up wearing long skirts and a cardigan and chunky jewelry. 

meeting other girls my age is good for me socially but dull for me intellectually. why?? why does it feel so hard to connect with some of these people my age? there's this joy that comes from being in a group but our lack of common interests leaves me gasping for hair. 

maybe diversity is another key value. i care about diverse experiences and diverse people and the office is stifling. verci is diverse but i dont know if its authentic?? everyone seems slightly different than who they really are 

girard has this theory of mimetic desire, which is, "*people model their desires after others, and that they want what they think others want*". It's why we go to a pop-up and wait for hours, or stand in a halal cart for hours, even without any personal desire to try the thing.

one may argue that we can derive our identity based on what we consume, whether it be content or clothing or media. so if an algorithm is pointing a certain age demographic into a certain bucket, of course our identities are going to converge. 

and i detest the idea that i can be predicted the same way another 22 year old asian girl in tech could be. maybe its this incessant idea that i need to *be different,* that the only way to *be authentic* is to go against the grain. why? why can't i just be happy with the way that i am? there

there are conversations i have when i go on autopilot. i can predict the next thing we're going to say and how the next response and response after that will go. some part of me wonders if im jaded by a constant influx of meeting new people, and if that the repetition is making me feel this way. at ashleys roof top i actively feel the saccharine sweetness in my voice.

what do i really desire outside of a mimetic framework? lets turn to [staring into the abyss as a core life skill](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/)

My hope with this essay is to convince you to stare into the abyss a bit more. To help with that, I’ll close with some uncomfortable but hopefully productive questions:

- If you had to leave your job today, what would you do instead?
    * work at a smaller company in product 
- What’s the best argument in favor of doing that right now?
    
- If you have a partner, what’s the best argument in favor of breaking up with them?
    
- Are there ways you behave that you wish you didn’t? What unacknowledged desires could be driving those?
