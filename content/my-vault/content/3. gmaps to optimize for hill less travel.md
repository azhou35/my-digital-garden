title: "3. gmaps to optimize for hill less travel"
---

problem statement:
- as a new mover into sf, how do i avoid the hills of sf?
- as a nyc native i like to walk around and i often face huge hills to get to point a to point b.
	- there's institutional knowledge: nob hill is a hill, etc
- obv there's the elevation option but i want to be able to curate walking routes to minimize hills. 

current options:
1. hill mapper
	1. https://sfist.com/2013/08/27/new_map_website_shows_where_the_ste/
	2. biking route 
		1. https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/16/google-maps-adds-elevation-profiles-to-bike-routes-to-help-you-avoid-those-steep-hills/ 
		2. elevation profile 
2. this still feels like an unsolved problem

ideal input:
idea #1 
- i input into this site my
	- starting location
	- ending locations (intermediaries)
	- constraints
- it outputs several options for routes 
	- as well as inputs on viewability
- exports to gmaps walking route 
- exstention to gmaps
