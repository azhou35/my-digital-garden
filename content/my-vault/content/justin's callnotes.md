meta comment: 
SO COOL and helpful to hear an aspirational call like this. theres the dance in the beginning trying to figure out each other's intentions and povs, and trying to find the common point of callibration, and also following up on each other's past experiences. i think the direct cta is always the spot where im nervy about but you integrate it rllyyy smoothly. im curious on your take on the convo LOL whether you liekd his approach of tackling all problems on once, and what he said about auditing vs the bigger pie. 
Takeaways:
- great to have an artifact summarizing your thoughts pre-call and point to it BUT the chance they read it is low
	- need to be ready to summarize it on the spot
- BE PREPARED to talk about your technical skills whyd they dig so deep lmao
- establish back-and-forths as well as provide "doorknobs that they can double click on "
	- eg: ive been thinking about *this* re Auditing and heres where i think the opportunity is
		- -> allows them to counter w their thoughts and why theyre hitting a bigger pie etc
- be prepared for these questions:
	- kind of on the lines of "what is your biggest strength"
		- i think the answer being able to ramp up quickly and capture the nuances of everything is actually super accurate to your strengths !! but the way it's phrased is almost vague? i DO like the blend example like "i knew nothing about mortgage lending but i ramped up on the workflows" -> maybe is there an example of how you did so? 
			- lol this is extreme but it reminds me of the classic airbnb founder story where they literally slept on couches to develop customer empathy. if there's a similar extreme story of how you immersed yourself to ramp up i think that would stand out and make your answer ~ sparkle ~
	- "what was your technical understanding at X? what technical problem did you solve"
		- tbh i dont like this question but maybe this is just an side effect of talking to technical founders (like one-to-one vs one-to-many is such a SPECIFIC term to ask about , lmao, and idk about u ive never looked at the actual data structure the engineers use except in school but maybe thats my job lmAO)
		- BUT YEAH WOW a reminder to be always ready to bust out a technical anecdote
