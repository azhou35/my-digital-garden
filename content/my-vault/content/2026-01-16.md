	- Random commands
	- "Command + shift + v" pastes as plain text
	- "Commmand + \ " removes formatting
- Organization
	- Need better habits on note taking, file organization, internal processes to go faster
	- Consistent formatting
		- Separate things into
			- Documents
			- Photos 
- Writing 
	- Interact log

	- Often times when you want to create a note for a book, a movie, an author, or some other "thing" that objectively exists / existed, what do you do?
	- Find info about it on the internet, then go back and forth copy / pasting or writing out details from it inside the corresponding note.
