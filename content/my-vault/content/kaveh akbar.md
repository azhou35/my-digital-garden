[Kaveh Akbar: “The Palace” | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/books/poems/kaveh-akbar-the-palace) 
In “The Miracle,” the originating myth of Islam unfolds as the angel Gabriel squeezes the breath, “the air of doubt,” out of the Prophet protesting his illiteracy, until he finds himself struck with the ability to read the scriptures. Here, our inner emptiness, “the vast cavities you have spent your life trying to fill,” is inverted into a small salvation: “Whatever you aren’t . . . is what makes you – a house is useful not because its floorboards or ceilings or walls, but because the empty space between them.” Perhaps part of the miracle is that literature is a thing that can fill us as though it were a substance, we who are “just one long desperation / to be filled.” Appetite and language join to find their guiding metaphor in the body as Akbar revels, “It’s delicious / being so governed // by the primacy / of my tongue.”
