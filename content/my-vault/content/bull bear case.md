title: "bull bear case"
---

for staying at microsoft as an operations pm vs going to scale as a tpm on the gen ai team right after their deal with meta.

bull case: 
i back out of my offer with scale. 

i get promoted to pm ii by september. either i jump to a startup in november or i wait for a bit for 2 years. maybe i move to an ai copilot team. 

we lead a late-june to september daily call. 
maybe i apply to a different team at microsoft. where else would i go? or i hope that baseten/modal labs/together take a shine to a junior pm.

within the 2-3 year market i parlay my experience into a gpu inference deployment platform. or work on openai. 

i build ai infra exp that helps me for a future ai infra startup. i can still work for something on the inference layer.

i reach out to fireworks / re-engage previous startups and get another offer in the fall. 

bear case:

i work on project management + coordination for operations - setting up meetings, aligning across stakeholders, making time tables, sharing with the customer.

i stay beyond september 2026 because i can't find a better option. i get stuck at microsoft longer than i want. i continue to emotionally burn out and disconnect from menial work. the longer i stay the harder to imagine i can get out. i waste the first two years of my career without learning and pushing myself. i pick up poor habits from working at microsoft and being comfortable for too long. 

by june 2026 openai doesnt need operations pms bc they have baremetal for self-managed service
the only skills ive developed is making presentations for different stakeholders and contract work and owning this planned maintenance process for mai / gb200s. this is going to happen in 1 year.

after 2 - 2.5 years i skip off to another ai startup in nyc as a pm, or i wait for 4 years and apply to openai/anthropic.

scale
**bull case:** 
scale is positioned to service meta's next agi lab. john is confident in the future of gen ai for data labelling, believing that either we 1) take an apps-level approach to servicing data for fortune 500 2) double down on data labelling for meta. talented people still stay at scale despite the uncertainty. 

i hit the ground running in a time of chaos. i have the autonomy to seize the high impact projects.

i learn an incredible amount and push myself to grow and work on difficult challenges. 

i grow out the evals product from 0 -> 1. 

i get promoted within 6 months and clear a higher salary than if i stayed at microsoft. 

scale moves from a services business to an apps business. 
i work on product manager-esque tasks.

heck, i work directly with meta's growing agi lab divison. 


**bear case:** 

the data labelling product explodes since all the ai labs pull out of their contracts with scale. (open ai has already churned, anthropic doesnt use them.) this move is one that prioritizes previous shareholders + top execs, but burns the current employees. i join and john my manager is poised to leave, or is unsure about the best path forward for his gen ai product. many other talented employees are poised to leave as well. 

its business model faces disruption as data labelling is increasingly automated. 

there's a lack of clear direction and movement forward as we become stuck as a data labelling service for meta. there's less product work to do due to the customer consolidation. 

i work at an ops-heavy organization where i am not empowered to make product decisions.
