title: "themes of invisible duel"
---


there are several themes here:
1. void - represents my potential, represents my freedom, represents the gap between who i am today and who i want to be tomorrow
	1. humans are viscerally uncomfortable with emptiness. we itch to fill up space in conversation, in places. when confronted w this void...
	2. 'l'appel du vide' means staring into the void and confronting primordial self 
	3. in the Zen Buddhism, void refers to 無心, to mean "no mind." 
		1. the void is also a space of emptiness and allows new ideas to emerge naturally - it allows your mind to wander and access a place that transcends normal consciousnesses.
	4. am i running away from this void or towards it? running is reactionary & also meditative.  
2. phantom - this invisible duel i have w a stranger who is not in direct competition with me, but in fact is a project of my own insecurities and inadequacies. *invisible duels don't just distract you - they diagnose you* the emotions that are triggered by these phantoms are symptoms of repressed desires and insecurities that i need to confront. it's a trap - these phantoms are not real to my world, and their success is not a blueprint not benchmark
3. teeth - i'm afraid of them falling out to reveal the voids inside me. their fall is a metaphor for running out of time to achieve my full potential - that i will sit around waiting for the perfect moment and will lose my teeth before i know it. 
4. running - the mechanism by which to simultaneously run away from the void (anxiety and restlessness) and run towards it (acquire self-transcendence and complete mental clarity)
