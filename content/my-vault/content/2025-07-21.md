### Why Perplexity 

How do you meet the APM program criteria? In 400 words or less, share how your accomplishments and experience align with what we’re seeking—shorter, focused responses are welcome.

Curiosity is the thread that connects everything I do. In high school, I taught machine learning to younger students and organized global hackathons and data visualizations during COVID. In college, I built ed-tech tools used by 5,000+ students. At Amazon, I became one of the youngest technical writers, making complex ideas legible to thousands. I write regularly about the intersection of AI and human connection.

Today, I’m a TPM at Microsoft Azure, orchestrating maintenance across thousands of GPUs powering OpenAI training workloads. These clusters support frontier-scale models—but the underlying systems are brittle. When a critical issue halted capacity and began bleeding thousands of dollars per hour, I sat shoulder-to-shoulder with senior engineers, rebuilt the recovery process, and turned it into a playbook now adopted by other hyperscale customers like ByteDance and Microsoft AI. I turn fragile systems into resilient ones, without losing sight of the humans inside them.

I believe great product leaders in the AI era are translators - between engineering and users, ambition and execution, vision and reality. I document relentlessly in Obsidian, mine my notes for second-order insights, and use AI tools to extend my thinking. I build systems to understand the world - and myself - better.

What excites me about Perplexity is your conviction that curiosity should compound. I see this team building something fundamentally new: an interface for human reasoning in the age of LLMs. I want to be part of that mission - not just as a builder, but as a relentless, thoughtful partner in shaping how we think and learn in the years to come.


Curiosity is the spark that drives me. I've been a tinkerer and a mover since high school - from teaching machine learning to kids in high school, to organizing hackathons, to organizing folks across the world to make data visualizations in covid, to shipping ed-tech products to 5k+ folks on campus, I've been always driven by a drive to understand the world. As one of the youngest technical writers at Amazon, I distilled technical concepts for thousands of people. I write regularly on the relation between AI and human connection.

This has led me to my first job as a TPM at Microsoft Azure. The problems I run towards are hairy, wicked, and often cast aside by teams. I excel at creating clarity in complex systems. My strength isn't just tireless execution - it's also in translating between the technical and non-technical. Impressive breakthroughs mean nothing when you lack the frame to share them. I’ve orchestrated hardware and software updates for over 5,000 GPUs powering OpenAI training workloads. I took an extremely manual process rife with human error into an automated, scalable experience that could extend to other supercomputing customers like Microsoft AI and Bytedance. Along the way, I've dug into issues shoulder-to-shoulder with senior engineers to determinedtly return capacity and prevent thousands of dollars by the hour from being lost.

What's perhaps important is I practice what I preach. I religiously document my thoughts and insights in Obsidian, and crawl through my internal knowledge database for second-derivative insights. I build for better thinking.

I firmly believe the product manager in the age of AI is the steward who can see around the corner and use their ambition and adaptabiltiy to drive new innovations from zero to one. What excites me about Perplexity is building for better thinking with AI. I want to join Perplexity because I believe curiosity is compounding, and this team is building a fundamentally novel way for how we understand the world.

My strength is zooming out to make complexity visible, then diving deep to eliminate blockers. I’ve rewritten workflows with latency-critical hardware teams, led root cause investigations into flaky CRDs, and built tools to reduce operational toil by 80%. I'm known for going where the problems are—technical enough to probe a Linux kernel trace, product-minded enough to turn friction into reusable design patterns.

> What makes me exceptional isn’t any one domain—it's the ability to make sense in ambiguity, build trust across disciplines, and ship things that last. I see Perplexity as a rare place where clarity, speed, and usefulness converge—and I’d be honored to contribute at the product frontier.

Since high school, I've been a tinkerer. Organizing hackathons, writing AI curriculum, 
Manifested into the past stint at Microsoft Supercomputing driving supercomputing infrastructure for OpenAI's largest workloads. In this I've sprinted alongside engineers to orchestrate GPU workloads and. 

i make complexity visible—then I help teams act on it. At Microsoft, I manage planned maintenance for supercomputers powering OpenAI’s training workloads: over 5,000 H100/H200 GPUs where downtime is expensive and ambiguity is everywhere. I wrote the playbook that turned an opaque, brittle process into an orchestrated rhythm of updates, de-risks, and retrospectives. Our work lives in the critical path—and I’ve learned to build trust across hardware, networking, and AI teams by getting the details right and making the system legible.

But my strength isn’t just execution—it’s storytelling. I write a blog and run events in NYC that draw hundreds of AI-curious technologists, researchers, and creatives. Writing has helped me sharpen product instincts, connect dots across disciplines, and build public clarity from private reflection. I don’t see product as a feature roadmap—I see it as a way of thinking. Who’s this for? What’s the leverage? How do we make the invisible visible?

I’m a power user of AI not just for speed, but for thought. I’ve used LLMs to model hardware failure modes, clarify PRDs, and debug systems with missing telemetry. More importantly, I teach others to think through AI—to use these tools to deepen understanding, not flatten it. I believe this mindset is what makes Perplexity special: it’s not just building with AI, but building _for_ better thinking.

What makes me exceptional isn’t that I’ve done one rare thing. It’s that I consistently go where the ambiguity is—and bring clarity. That I can hold my own in an infrastructure root cause, a user interview, or a product review. That I write to think, lead with humility, and move fast with care.

I want to join Perplexity because I believe curiosity is compounding—and few teams move faster or think more clearly at the edge of product and AI. This isn’t just the future of search. It’s the future of how we understand the world—and I want to help build it..


Perplexity APMs are individuals who have accomplished remarkable things, want to immerse themselves fully in AI product development at global scale, and possess an unrivaled work ethic. We're looking for:

Individuals with exceptional talent that defies convention, whether proven in AI, physics, poker, or any other field—traditional and unconventional backgrounds welcome.

Self-starters who set high standards, work relentlessly, and approach challenges with creativity.

Insatiable curiosity and a tinkerer’s spirit.

Natural AI power users who grasp the latest tools, use them to amplify their own strengths, and inspire those around them.

Excellent writers, communicators, planners, and analytical thinkers who can define problems and deliver clarity.

People who can hold their own with top engineers—not necessarily coding daily, but with strong technical understanding and a keen sense for complexity and tradeoffs.

Team players who go where needed most—no task is too small if it helps colleagues or users.

Leaders who bring relentless enthusiasm, support their teammates, and lead with humility—never ego.

Focus on what you make yourself exceptional. We're looking for evidence that you can do something that few others in the world can do.
