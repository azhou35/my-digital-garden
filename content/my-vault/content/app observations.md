##### Patterns
* The free version is lighter and quick, but it may be bogged down by feature creep (e.g. Habitica) or simply less refined UI choices (also Habitica with its laundry list of features within the hamburger menu.
* The paid version usually is bogged down by ads (e.g. Pinterest) which worsens my expeience based on why I go to the app -- eg if I go to Pinterest for unique discovery I don't want the same shops I've been scrolling thru 
##### Personal Prefs
1. Avoid feature bloat. I prefer multiple apps tailored to executing one function seamlessly, as opposed to an all-in-one one-stop-shop super app. 
	1. The corollary of this is beautiful design. This is not aesthetic design - this is design that makes you forget about the frame the solution was presented within and solely immersed in the intended experience.
