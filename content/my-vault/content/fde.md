title: "fde"
---

FDEs span what would traditionally be separate roles for sales, solutions, or support engineering. They drop those barriers and are tasked with helping prospects and customers through the entire customer lifecycle. The end outcome is a successful deployment of the product.  
  
I’ve always told our entire team that a customer isn’t won until they’ve shipped. And FDEs embody that mindset.  
  
At Inkeep, we expect an FDE to:  
- Works directly with a customer to scope out how they want to deploy AI across their product and support systems.  
- Helps a customer’s engineering team integrate Inkeep, directly contributing to how they customize and deploy  
- Become a product expert, with broad knowledge on how companies are rolling out AI successfully across internal and external CX workflows.  
  
If you’re an engineer that enjoys solving engineering problems as much as you enjoy working with customers, check out this role. Link in comments.
