statement of purpose

i am a photographer by heart and a writer by curse. both of these are methods of using tools in order to document the world around me and imagine new ways of seeing the mundane and often overlooked.

with these creative sensibilities, i take a photographer's eye for detail and a writer's angst for meaning-making and inform the technology that i seek and build to help people see the world more clearly. i grew up with a love for humanities and literature, an enjoyment for world building by writing and role-playing with my friends. yet i recognize that the power to change the world lies within the innovators. the technologists who seize both technical progress and visionary thinking and have the audacity to challenge the status quo and insist on a new way of thinking. 

*the dots only connect when looking backwards.* i am the process of making connections within the intersections, finding the deep fundamental synergy across disparate fields.

both humanities and tech seek to understand the human experience. the humanities provides context for technological change. 

to *world-build* is to carry empathy and intention into whatever system or force or idea you aim to bring to reality. 
i want to take the world in all its beauty as i see it today, and bring it to greater futures with the worlds i imagine tomorrow.
