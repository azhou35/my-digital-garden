title: "thoughts on yingtao"
---

i entered the hells kitchen with a thesis that chinese cuisine is misrepresented on the fine dining scene and that yingtao, perhaps, had potential to break through. 
with a weak french x chinese theme, everything was uninspiring and poorly executed. the sea bass with flowers and goji berries was overcooked.
