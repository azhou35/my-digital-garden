im stressed about this potnetial nyc vs sf move 

can you separate your internal desires from 
we parrot surface-level interaction
any girl to girl intera tion follows a similar script

in the age of panoptican how do you build a brand


is this everything i ever wanted?
self improvement is a lie 

row by row
going 
racks 
1. has that been validated by engineer from an inrush pov
2. have we validated the timer

no timer when u turn them onn

1. validate that you had done the inrush 
delay in the gb200
it waits for the cooling to be ready 
and then gb200s power up
nv switches power on right away

first row slowly
wait for tat to go true

3 racks per row tht get turned on
is there a concern for inrush even w 3 racks
150 KW rack

bakcup: bustap by bustap
reduce inrush 
if some reason delay isnt working 

**We tested the delay**

1 busway and then do other busway and then wait to validate it's ok.
