title: "questions for Lai Rai"
---

Asian regions are not particularly well-renown for being wine regions - yet there's a surge in cultural-themed wine bars in the city. Natural wine’s boom meets Asian cultural roots—e.g., how fish-sauce caramel pairs with skin-contact whites. I'd love to interview a host of people - Richard Jang from Sinsa, the Mam / Di and Di team behind La Rai. Questions to ask include - how do you cultivate a mysterious yet culturally accurate space within the competitive nightlife scene? I'd like to explore the delicate balance between authenticity and accessibility in design and atmosphere. This piece would also examine how these spaces challenge traditional wine culture hierarchies.

1. Tell me about your backgrounds in food & beverage, and how that led you to starting Lai Rai. 
2. What inspired the initial concept of Lai Rai? Was there a specific moment or experience that sparked the idea? 
3. The inclusion of ice creams and wine is unique, especially with the particular flavors you highlight. How do you approach menu development - do you prioritize traditional Vietnamese recipes, seasonal ingredients, or dishes that pair specifically with your wine program? 
4. Can you talk about the role of community in your business model? How do you balance creating an exclusive atmosphere while remaining accessible to the neighborhood? 
5. How do you incorporate your personal heritage and experiences into the space without falling into stereotypes or clichés? What role does music play in creating the atmosphere at Lai Rai? Does it change throughout service? 
6. I had the special Vietnamese rice wine my last couple of visits; could you describe your relationship with local suppliers and the sourcing philosophy behind your ingredients?
7. How do you see Lai Rai evolving over time? Are there aspects of the concept you're still developing or hope to introduce?
