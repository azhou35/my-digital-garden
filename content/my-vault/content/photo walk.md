title: "photo walk"
---

my go-to weekend activity is going on photowalks with a friend. we pick a neighborhood or an activity and explore through our 35mm lens. i'm a chinatown frequenter, but i'm normally rushing through the streets, weaving through the crowd on the narrow roads and dodging people carrying packages in search of a $1 char siu bun. rarely do i stand still, especially in a street as well-trafficked as mott.

photography forces me to slow down and submit myself to my surroundings. i'm easily impatient and overly jittery, so sitting still in one place isn't my usual style. i'm also usually chatty -- this is a rare moment when i shut up.

ever since last year, i've zoned in on street photography as my favorite style, over landscape and portrait. it's a style that invites a trigger finger. the window of opportunity for a shot is so short: you're moving, your subject is moving, other people are moving, so keep your head down and your hand poised to shoot. 

i've been trying to develop a style, and I think my ideal photo treats setting as a character alongside the subjects. capturing people is still paramount -- what are eyes for if not to see one another -- i want to see how people interact with the [[make setting a character|setting]].
