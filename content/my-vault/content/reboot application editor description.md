# **Editor**

Editors are the core of Reboot’s work, driving what we cover and how we cover it.

“Editing” can mean many things—imagine a hybrid editor/producer/PM/doula for ideas—and we’re especially excited to support individuals in crafting the kind of role you’re most excited about. We celebrate curiosity and conviction in all its forms. The most important quality is the courage to give a shit.

### **Responsibilities**

- **Editors are primarily responsible for producing something kickass for Reboot at least once every 3 months.** 
    
    - Format and topic are flexible: it can look like writing a short story, hosting an event, commissioning and editing an essay, or recording a podcast.
        
    - MEs are responsible for end-to-end production, from ideation to creation to publishing to distribution. 
        
    - For collaborative works, editors should play a major role as the primary creator or heavily involved thought partner.
        
- **Editors are expected to edit and advise each other’s work**. We encourage attending the weekly Zoom, but active async participation works too.
    
- Editors are encouraged to attend a (funded) annual in-person gathering.
    
- Editors are encouraged to chip in to support community events, magazine logistics, general Reboot promo, and more. 
    

### **Qualifications**

- **You’re a great storyteller.** You can switch between personal perspective and systemic analysis. You excel at breaking down complex topics—technical, political, etc—into simple language. You care about craft. You have the samples to prove it. 
    
- **You love editing and being edited**—thought-partnering with others to create excellent work. You see editing as not just a cosmetic touch-up, but a way to shape ideas from the start. You relish feedback and receive critique with curiosity. 
    
- **You have a strong perspective.** You don’t need formal expertise, but we want to hear passion, nuance, and conviction in your takes. You can help us map the key players in a field and separate level 0 from level 5 takes. 
    
- **You’re intellectually curious.** You’re excited to learn new things and seek differing opinions. You love going from problem to solution, and from theory to practice. You do the extra reading to get things right.
    
- **You don’t mind self-promotion.** Cringe, I know. But distribution is where good content goes to die, so we’ll need you to help get your work in front of the people and partners who are best poised to learn from it.
    
- **You** _**get**_ **Reboot.** Finally, we hope that you’re familiar with our newsletter and _Kernel Magazine_, you generally vibe with “[Take Back the Future!](https://substack.com/redirect/140d7e6b-4f53-4fd1-9025-b905ea28ba0b?j=eyJ1IjoiN2hncTgifQ.NvuD9a5O8v2NlzCirmoOl0QleBRaT6HGt_ZPIOWvNYg)” and “[Does Tech Criticism Still Matter?](https://substack.com/redirect/121a6ee3-c0e7-4f90-83e1-02966a84a8f3?j=eyJ1IjoiN2hncTgifQ.NvuD9a5O8v2NlzCirmoOl0QleBRaT6HGt_ZPIOWvNYg)”, and you see the potential for Reboot to go somewhere great.
    

### **Compensation**

- Editors will be compensated at a base of $750/quarter for the single artifact, and $1000/quarter if you produce 2+ artifacts.
    
- Editors are committed for a 12-month term, from August 2024 to July 2025.
    

_We can increase this rate if it poses a barrier to your participation. We know your time is more valuable than this—consider it more of a thank you stipend than a fair wage._ 

### **Application**

**[Apply here by July 30](https://substack.com/redirect/16c19273-6682-4e4b-b9e7-6f161f8ba8c2?j=eyJ1IjoiN2hncTgifQ.NvuD9a5O8v2NlzCirmoOl0QleBRaT6HGt_ZPIOWvNYg).** It should take 20-30 minutes.
