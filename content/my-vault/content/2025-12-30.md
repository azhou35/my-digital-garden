for love of the game
- what actually calls you

core tensions
can you live life at the extremes? 

- analog enjoyment and digital extremes
- host vs participant
	- hosting vs being at an event
	- documenter vs attendee vs organizer is a constant three-way split
- authenticity/performance
	- “handmade” proof-of-presence (film, scrapbooks, handwritten letters, Midori notebook), analog friction as honesty
		- Proof of Presence 
	- and the desire for writing that “drops into the moment” instead of metacommentary.
	- share without performance
	- script personas and host events with Pinterest-level polish
- discipline/whimsy 
### 2025 investment letter

2025 was the year of performative males, bemoaning the persona who holds tote bags and drinks matcha. i found this trend quite peculiar - isn't all a life a performance? i buy a polene purse to indicate quiet luxury. 

there's this dual tension i hold as an asian girlie in tech. i want to differentiate myself and stand out, but deeply, earnestly, yearn to assimilate and be like everyone else. 

at raves when i don't want to drink, i pop an edible and always feel removed from my body. i watch myself dance in third person, the lights streaking through a body that no longer belongs to mine. 

ai slop and ai-generated videos galore. where is the proof of presence here? i fail the twitter authentication gatekeeper at least 4 times and i question again what is my own personhood here. 

i think i fear being flattened, that i am not as interesting as i perceive myself to be. 

when i ask claude to do math it creates a program to compute the calculations. everything is just bits and bytes. 

*all we can do today is to be authentic*

is prose personal or passive? do i live life or does it pass through me? is substack my truest voice or is it again a reflection of what i want to project into the world? 

i write towards a certain truth, which implies there is an objectivity. 

personal branding has exploded this year: tik tok girlies are picking up substack, companies are raising capital off of the promise of capturing attention. we dont need the metaverse to facilitate avatars - we are creating our own personas for the digital layer of the internet. at the same time, consumer brands have breached the personal - leveraging influencers and pop-ups to capture the hearts of america. 2 hour lines in soho just to get a free moisterizer. 

i hide behind metacommentary and relinquish my permission to feel. 

there's this piece i return to, that always asks: what are you avoiding because it conflicts with some part of your identity / self-image?

*degrees of freedom*

there are certain anchors - mundane routines, like morning coffee. there are moments of peace and serenity and awe. 

as much humans, i live life in the extremes. i am fueled by the highs and the lows. 


I want Proof of Presence, i want to see my handwriting smear on the page. 
rabbit holes to go into:
- storage
- why is there no chinese fine dining
	- i always watch culinary class wars
	- **70–80 Chinese restaurants listed** across regions covered by Michelin (this includes all quality levels the guide lists, not strictly fine dining).[](https://guide.michelin.com/en/us/restaurants/chinese?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- fancy chinese food is about weird textures that taste like saliva
	- imperial chinese food 
	- cheap connotation
	- lack of services
	- mister jius 
		- mainly white ppl
	- korean food is well balanced due to fermentation
- fine dining system designed for Chinese food look
- google travel
	- why is it so hard to do 
- china
	- app culture 
	- shen zhen hardware manufacturing
- Why did the fabs leave Silicon Valley
- mixed zone housing in shanghai/japan vs ktown 
- **How did they approve Waymo?**
	- 250,000 rides and 2 million miles of unsupervised autonomous driving every week right now
	- history of cars
	- [[content/self driving cars - waymo|self driving cars - waymo]]
	- how it will affect future city design 
	- whaat is a future city built with self driving cars 
		- will it fix traffic?
		- will it fix car storage?
	- https://medium.com/@gwrx2005/resilience-of-robotaxi-systems-waymo-vs-tesla-in-the-december-2025-san-francisco-blackout-e84bf6619078
- why does it cost so much to replace a traffic light
	- https://www.catrentalstore.com/content/crs/en_US/blog/traffic-light-installation.html/
- [[content/maintenance, deferred]]
	- Should it be this hard to maintain trains? Here, or anywhere else?
	- reduce, reuse, recycle
	- There is tension in the question of whether to build objects more intensively, so that they last longer, or to recognize that some things cannot endure and thus should be designed that way
	- example
		- chinese buildings that are built with less resilient materials that require more maintenance 
		- buddhist monk temples that are well maintained
	- Sustainability is a state; maintenance is a process
	- the ability to service your own property is a primary tenet of freedom
	- Maintenance mostly happens out of sight, mysteriously. If we notice it, it’s a nuisance. When road crews block off sections of highway to fix potholes, we treat it as an obstruction, not a vital and necessary process.
	- https://anthrobookforum.americananthro.org/the-promise-of-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com
	- interplay between maintenance and repair work
	- maintenance is overwhelmingly seen as a cost centre, something to bow to budget and schedules. It’s recognized _in theory_ as valuable and yet there seems to be a massive disconnect when it comes to actually implementing it.

it is december 30 and i have procrastinated my end of year reflection to the end of the year.
