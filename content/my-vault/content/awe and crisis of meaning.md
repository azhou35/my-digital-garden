title: "awe and crisis of meaning"

*why our capacity for awe is humanity's most undervalued skill*

We ought to view ourselves with the same curiosity and openness with which we study a tree, the sky or a thought, because we too are linked to the entire universe.

we live in a culture obsessed with personal branding & main character energy. yet, we are perhaps the only species that actively seeks the feeling of insignificance. 

a tree never contemplates its own majesty. an eagle doesn't pause mid-flight to marvel at the vastness below. 

but humans? we climb mountains just to feel dwarfed by them; we stare at stars as reminders of our own cosmic irrelevance. we seek experiences that make us feel beautifully, purposefully small.

this impulse has a name: the capacity for awe. and it's the answer to our epidemic of self-importance and our crisis for meaning.

in early june, i took a trip to sf. it's chillier than i expected for a may afternoon. laying on a blanket at the painted ladies. i note that there's something voyeuristic about viewpoints—the nature exists at a safe distance, the buildings and ocean collaborating to create an idyllic frame for our consumption.

i raise my camera to capture the victorian houses: the viewfinder creating distance just as much as it demands presence. a way, i do what i always do: watching myself watch the view.

earlier this year i came across the term "syncresis"[1](https://michaelnotebook.com/cosmos/index.html?curius=2215,1062,4233,4347,4287,3092,3085,3074,2825,2551,2055,1935,1592#fn1), in which two (or more) apparently opposed points of view are seen to really be instances of a single more powerful point of view. photography embodies this as a way to both immerse and distance yourself from a moment. 

but sometimes you go from observing nature to *experiencing it.*
nature is always in the purview here. but nature also serves to ground you. perhaps the biggest surprise to me as a forever east coaster is the sheer height of the californian reds. on a hike at land's end, i jerk my chin up at the trees that frame me, my neck nearly snapping like a stick. a mangled mixture descended in my throat that can only be described as fear and wonder. 

suddenly your self-importance shrinks. and you feel very small. 

**awe is anti-algorithmic, anti-personal brand, anti-main character energy.** It asks us to consider that we might not be the center of the universe—and finds this possibility not deflating but liberating.

When the mountains are in the distance, I retain my agency, framing nature as I see fit. But when I'm within the trees, their sheer magnitude dwarfs my figure. The difference isn't just physical—it's ontological. There's something about being away from home—seeing a new city, attending a concert, observing a natural park—that increases your permeability to wonder. Any disruption to daily routine leaves you vulnerable to being overwhelmed.

full immersion demands your attention. we've trained ourselves to dopamine hits from social media - highlight reels of sunsets, mountain views, perfectly framed starscapes. 

there's something about being away from home that *increases your permeability to wonder.* it comes from seeing a new city, going to a concert, observing a natural park - any disruption to daily routine leaves you vulnerable to being overwhelmed. like a sponge you soak up this new experience, even if you can't quite understand the full picture of its majesty. 

the sublime can manifest in several flavors: grand sweeping landscapes, powerful musical performances, even the everyday crowd of people. or it can be great scientific ideas, even religion.

we're living through a *crisis of meaning* [Crisis of meaning and how to facilitate transitions in life | by Dr Gabriel Barsawme | Better Humans](https://medium.com/better-humans/crisis-of-meaning-and-how-to-facilitate-transitions-in-life-dad10610bf60) - a collective sense that life may lack some strict purpose. traditional sources of meaning that drove secular societies, such as religion or community, have faded away. our alternative modus operandi is to relentlessly focus on *the self*, with constant personal goals and aesthetic fine-tuning. but this approach often backfires, leading to a hedonic treadmill that makes us feel just as meaningless as we started.


We're living through what researchers call a "crisis of meaning"—a collective sense that life may lack strict purpose. Traditional sources of meaning that once anchored secular societies—religion, community, shared narratives—have faded away. Our alternative approach has been to relentlessly focus on _the self_, with constant personal goals and aesthetic fine-tuning.

But this approach often backfires, leading to a hedonic treadmill that makes us feel just as meaningless as we started. Social media amplifies this problem by turning our lives into performance art, where every moment must be optimized, curated, and broadcasted for validation.


this is where awe becomes radical. rather than shy away from inexplicable beauty, seek out experiences that overwhelm us. that's how you expand your capacity for wonder. 

awe invites a paradox. do you find this enlightening - a comforting feeling of interdependence - or terrifying - a dizzying reminder of insignificance?

we have no control over when awe strikes but we can choose how we respond. we can either become terrified or empowered, retreating deeper within ourselves or move towards deeper understanding. 

*awe is a lightning bolt that marks in memory those moments when the doors of perception are cleansed and we see with the startling clarity what is truly important life.*

the next weekend i flew to vegas for a music festival. vastness stretches her limbs outwards rather than upwards - etherized against the desert landscape and ripe for dissection. to get to the festival grounds entails a shuttle ride through the deserted air force complex - within the endless road of human ambition and artifice.

**can be a powerful source of awe**

in a crowd of people you lose yourself, in every sense of the phrase. here you lose all sense of time, all sense of self. 

bass vibrates through your ribs and rattles in its new-found cage, transmitting movement to the rest of your body. pressed against the bodies of thousands, yet completely alone in the way that i perceive and react to the music.

But awe doesn't only come from nature. Sometimes it emerges from the most human of experiences: losing yourself in a crowd.

this is what psychologists call "collective effervescence"—that feeling of individual boundaries dissolving into something larger. when you put your phone down and stop yourself from documenting the moment, you surrender yourself to a collectiveness.

at one point during the night we mount the bleachers on the side of the stage to rest and observe the entirety of the festival in its totality. from this vantage point see the full scale of the stage, what two hundred thousand attendees look like from afar. as blood-red fireworks pierce the twilight sky i fixate on the tiny specks of people in the crowd at the main stage. if i had zoomed out of myself during the set, is this how i look like? an mote of dust in the distance, one of many in an endless desert? 

you surrender yourself to the loss of control. 

when william shatner first went to space, he expected to understand the full harmony of the universe. instead, he felt its fullest isolation. 

the pale blue dot among other carl sagan books always fascinated me growing up. the syncresis of science: how a big bold universe is made up of tiny particles, how a scientist peers into a cell which makes up a whole living organism. based on what you're looking at you can use a telescope or a microscope. 

the tailsend of may was marked by a trip to my partner's hometown, where i met his parents for the first time. deeply spiritual, their parents took me to the temple, where i soaked in the practices of age-old traditions - walking around the figureheads, touching the figureheads, kneeling down and kissing the floor. in this moment i felt the syncresis - pointedly individual and distinct while inexplicibly part of something greater.

this was the final chapter of awe: an understanding that there is something greater than the material world. buddhism, catholocism, hinduism, are all conduits of awe and an acknowledgement that there are certain phenomoena that escape explanation.
