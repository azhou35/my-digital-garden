Depends what you mean. Is Google a product studio? What about Anthropic? If so, then yes we hope to be. But if the question is are we a typical product studio that’s looking to ship lots of different apps, no we definitely aren’t. We’re building [getashelf.com](http://getashelf.com/), as well as the underlying infrastructure to power Shelf. On the journey to getting to Shelf, we built a number of iterations that all were trying to solve the same core problems. We no longer maintain them, but they helped us hone our understanding of what to build.
