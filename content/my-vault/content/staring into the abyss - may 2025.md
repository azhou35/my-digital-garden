[Staring into the abyss as a core life skill | benkuhn.net](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/)

- If you had to leave your job today, what would you do instead?






	- PM at a smaller company
- What’s the best argument in favor of doing that right now?
	- You are 23 and arguably at the best time to take risks / intake paycut bumps
- - Are there ways you behave that you wish you didn’t? What unacknowledged desires could be driving those?
	- I am unable to focus on simple workstreams (aka admin tasks) and feel way less productive. 
- [What have you said “yes” to that you wouldn’t say “hell yes” to?](https://sive.rs/hyn) (prompted by [Alex Watt](https://twitter.com/alexcwatt))
- Is there something you “should” do that you’re not currently doing? Why? (prompted by [Silas Strawn](https://twitter.com/silas_strawn))
- - What bad things are you afraid of happening? [Imagine in detail what it would be like if they happened.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3XgYbghWruBMrPTAL/leave-a-line-of-retreat) (prompted by [Kamilé Lukosiute](https://twitter.com/kamilelukosiute))
	- I am afraid of the wost case where I take a job where i am working an inordinate amount of hours and my personal fulfillment suffers and it doesnt meaningfully help my career compared to riding it out at microsoft
	- I also fear being behind/not being ahead. My biggest fear is that by 30 i live a career that im not proud of. I fear my dad's fate, always being passed over for MD promotion. I fear being in my sister's position, chained to a university teaching students in an excruciating manner by age 30. 
- What do you need that you’re not currently getting? (—[David MacIver](https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1478016162092965889))
	- I need a challenge and actual things to do. 
- What are you avoiding because it conflicts with some part of your identity / self-image? (—[Nicholas Schiefer](https://twitter.com/nschiefer/status/1478181997965197315); more at link)

- “What is the biggest thing in your life that you just kinda casually fell into and would you have made a conscious decision to do it if you’d known in advance everything you know now?” (—[@GeniesLoki](https://twitter.com/GeniesLoki/status/1309411888753762304); hundreds more at link)

What do I actually do at my job?
* write documents
* set up meetings
* coordinate across different people to understand what updates go into an update window
* keep track of usage reporting data 
* get info from smes, give it to customer openai
	* dm ppl to get info 
* run sql queries to get information 


Where do I want to be by 30?
* Some role models: 
	* Rebecca Hu
	* Notion PM Michelle

Where do I want to be by 25? 
* PM at some hype startup
