Much like how the namesake Hume perceived philosophy as an experimental science, my superpower lies at the intersection of the analytical and the abstract. From AI research in college to scaling AI supercomputing infrastructure at Microsoft, I've consistently engaged with ethical frameworks for AI development.

At Hume, I'd imagine my role as a technical PM who can optimize product-market fit for the EVI 2 platform while driving strategic API adoption. I picture myself hopping on calls with key customers to prototype solutions for their specific workflows, bolstered by my background prototyping Copilot solutions for researchers. I imagine coordinating across development, design, and growth to prioritize and build new features that accelerate adoption of the Octave TTS functionality. Having worked across AI infrastructure, dev tools, and documentation for both, I can evolve your platform based on developer feedback while maintaining excellent technical communication. Most importantly, I can spearhead success metrics that align technical growth with Hume's mission of improving well-being through emotional intelligence. 

My interest in voice AI stems from a conviction that voice represents the next frontier in human-computer interaction. Growing up with immigrant parents, I experienced firsthand how language barriers can limit emotional expression—watching them struggle to convey nuanced feelings in their second language showed me how technology could bridge these gaps. This personal connection has driven my exploration of voice AI tools, from collaborating with Cartesia on narration features to discussing multilingual capabilities with ElevenLabs.

However, what makes Hume stand out from the competitors is your approach to emotional dimensions as continuous gradients rather than discrete categories. I believe that as AI advances, frameworks like yours don't just digitize emotion but expand "the vocabulary of human connection" - helping us explore our emotional capabilities more deeply rather than simply mimicking them. I've explored this topic in my personal blog (https://anniewhere.substack.com/p/random-walks-01-digital-and-physical), but I look forward to stepping outside of the realm of theory and put these ideas into practice as a TPM at Hume.

Since conducting AI research in college through scaling AI supercomputing infrastructure at Microsoft, I've been deeply engaged with ethical frameworks for AI development.

I've been experimenting with voice AI tools, working with Cartesia for growth on their narration features and chatting with ElevenLabs on their multi-lingual features. However, what makes Hume stand out is your approach to emotional dimensions as continuous gradients rather than discrete categories. Your semantic space theory with over 20 distinct emotional dimensions reflects how I've come to understand human connection. I believe that as AI advances, frameworks like yours don't just digitize emotion but expand "the vocabulary of human connection" - helping us explore our emotional capabilities more deeply rather than simply mimicking them.

I'm seeking a company that empowers me to both think critically about AI's potential and execute on that vision. Hume's mission to build technology that understands human emotional expression to better serve human goals represents exactly the kind of work I want to contribute to.
At Hume, I'd imagine my role as a technical PM who can optimize product-market fit for the EVI 2 platform while driving strategic adoption of your emotional AI capabilities. My experience implementing Azure's Copilot solutions for researchers has prepared me to bridge technical complexity with practical applications - crucial for expanding your API adoption across key verticals. Having worked in both AI infrastructure and documentation, I can help evolve your platform based on developer feedback while maintaining excellent technical communication. Most importantly, my background exploring the philosophical dimensions of human-AI connection positions me to help define success metrics that align technical growth with Hume's mission of improving well-being through emotional intelligence. I'd be thrilled to help transform Hume from an innovative technology into an industry-defining platform during this pivotal growth phase.


I'm no stranger to the complexities of navigating healthcare and insurance - as the child of immigrants, I saw first-hand their struggles interpreting dense insurance policies and healthcare claims at the dining table. I spent hours on the phone with doctors and pharmacies to translate 

medical jargon and ensure my parents received the care they needed.
