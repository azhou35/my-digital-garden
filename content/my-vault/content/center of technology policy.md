Reach out to Archana

Hey Archana!

I'm Annie, and I'm currently a TPM at Microsoft Azure working on supercomputing infrastructure for our AI customers like OpenAI. My first foray into AI was in high school as part of AI4ALL - in partnership with Princeton's Center of Technology, we dived into the ethical concerns that companies should consider. Ironically, in spearheading Microsoft's biggest AI project, I feel like I've lost the plot. 

I'm currently at a juncture where I want to be more intentional on where I take my career, and I want to revisit some of my previous questions about ethical applications of AI in industry. In my search for companies with a safety-first approach to AI development, I came across Dynamo AI. Reaching out - I've seen you around in the Reboot community! - as I'd love to learn about your path. I saw that you have a similar background starting at Microsoft, and I'd love to learn how you leaned into researching AI fairness and coalescing these interests into your PM practice. 

Let me know if you'd be open for a chat - on carving a path that is mission-aligned with personal values, on finding opportunities to research trust and fairness in AI, and even how community through Reboot has guided your thinking. 

Appreciate the time! 
Cheers,
Annie

Now I work on supercomputing & AI infrastructure at Microsoft as a product manager.

As innovation outpaces policy, I'm wrestling with how to center human impact beyond metrics.  
I'm inspired to explore critical questions about our future: how do we evaluate data accuracy and fairness, especially given geographic and demographic limitations in current datasets, especially if we use synthetic data? As a technologist, how do I translate nuanced value systems into product development, ensuring human impact remains central? How can we make AI innovation in scientific computing more interpretable and ethically grounded?
