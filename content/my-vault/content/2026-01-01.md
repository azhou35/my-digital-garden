	- _The Library of Missing Datasets_ (2015–ongoing) is a series of physical repositories that examine what is systematically excluded in our data-saturated society. The project maps the "blank spots" where information should exist but doesn't—absences that reveal cultural values and power structures more clearly than what we choose to collect.
	- The series begins with an ongoing archive of empty folders, each titled with a missing dataset drawn from a master list Ọnụọha has maintained since 2015. As the artist writes, "The word 'missing' is inherently normative; it implies both a lack and an ought: something does not exist, but it should." These absences disrupt established systems, offering cultural hints about what society deems important—or disposable.

themes:
- i like the trees - they make me feel small 
	- i actively seeks the feeling of insignificance
	- the thing about trees is that you see the rings accumulate, they wear their age in the trunk 
	- *awe* strikes your heart like a lightning bolt, leaving you unshakeably moved. 
	- buildings, too
	- i dont naturally gravitate towards nature but they help me feel small
	- they resist the passage of time 
	- its the idea that someday i can also create something great 
	- other cultural moments that made me feel small:
		- one thing dating n has indoctrinated in me is the idea of american sports
			- going to an american baseball game, standing up to sing *take me to the ball game*
		- concerts/raves - there are times i go without my sunnies, and i hyperfixate on watching the people around me 
			- at edc - you see how big the expansive concert hall is
	- i am grateful to have this feeling because it means i have fell into experiences that are larger than life 
		- and that i am part of something greater
	- feeling smallness in comparison to something greater means that you are part of the fabric of life 
- the truth is during solitude all sorts of instrusive questions emerge 
- all year ive been circling around ben kuhn's idea of *staring into the abyss*
	- https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/, like a stray cat nursing a half-eaten kill. 
	- What are you avoiding because it conflicts with some part of your identity / self-image? 
	- some core contradictions i have arrived at:
- not all games are made equal
	- _The philosopher Kwame Appiah writes that “in life, the challenge is not so much to figure out how best to play the game; the challenge is to figure out what game you’re playing.”_
	- dating, career, social media 
	- we crave benchmarks that are legibile 
- *the longer you deny yourself alignment, the more time runs out* 
	- leading into 2025 i was proud of myself for living a well-balanced life. the only nagging feeling was re: my job - i felt like i was wasting time. in 2024 i convinced myself i could live a complete 5-9 to offset the ennui in my 9-5. 
	- alignment - how do i create a life that is so attuned to my values
	- second-derivative of prioritizing *authenticity*, the byproduct being i am 1) picky and 2) impatient
		- degree to which a person's actions are congruent with their with their values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity
	- i believe there is the best fit, in all dimensions of life 
		- this also begets a sense of agency
		- i get frustrated when my friends tell me *i need to stay in this job at least 2 years* - which is prob why i never went into finance
		- or that this friend constantly takes advantage of them 
		- i want a job that: 
			- impacts people 
			- demands focus 
			- edge of technology
			- allows me to work with people and also have technical work
		- i want a life that is:
			- well-balanced 
			- opening me to new eperiences
			- involves bringing people together
	- frustrated when buying clothes 
		- buy boots only to return them
- *it's easy to get along with everyone - but you dont need to get them to stay* 
	- you aren't just an average of the five people around you - it is all *relational*
		- i take this to mean that the combination of your two inputs - and how you meet in conversation - should create something uniquely generative 
			- e.g. me and j frequently cohost together, but we're also thought partners in how we think about community and other people,
			- me and v and j love to sit ont the floor and play catan 
		- can't just be achieved by hanging out with "cool people"
		- "but it is important to note that curating your milieu isn't only or even primarily about being picky. it is about how you relate to people."
		- The ethos should be a sum of our values, but it won't directly map onto our individual motivations, and sometimes that ethos is as simple as _I care about this friend group and I will show up, over and over again
			- is care sustained? intimacy is not a proxy for closeness
- there is an objective truth - without fundamentals, beauty collapses
	- social media prioritizes *trends* - aesthetics is so easily consumable by the glazed-over viewer
  
	- platonic ideal of food 
		- picky picky eater 
		- what goes into an ideal pastry:
			- buttery, flaky
			- it shows good technique 
		- without a concrete fundamental the pastry itself falls apart
			- e.g. bad croissants in sd
- there are signals - but check if your measurement systems are correct 
	- e.g. 
- *it's easier to build rather than maintain*
	- starting is exciting, monumental, easy to point to 
	- but there is a money tree i always forget to water 
	- i have a trigger finger when it comes to creating a new ig account 
	- a new side hustle, a new theme 
	- did quite well in achieving the first pass of all my aspirations - one cafe, one photo gallery
	- sustained activity of writing club

intentions for 2026:
- reflect less, commentate more
	- good at passive observation, bc its safe and easy 
	- writing from within me 
	- but i have a pov, i have opinions, *articulate them!*
- read hard things
	- i like thinkpieces bc they do the thinking for you
		- read more critical lit 
- maintenance mode
	- i think up to your early 20s you get away with some bad habits
		- bad brushing skills, poor ergonomics, poor skin care
		- get ahead of these 
- embrace nature 
	- part of my disatisfaction of west coast living is i compare the urban exp w nyc
	- writers get the most inspiration from nature
	- there is an inner calling to the trees / lakes and i feel it like a scratch in the back of my throat
	- go to sausolito , marin, go crabbing, fishing 
- converge creativity & technology !!
	- i am a creative heart
	- i am a technologist
		- but i have yet to converge these into being a *creative technologist*


i spent at least a third of my weekends seized by the metronome at a concert.


projects, deferred:
- collective memory
	- [[content/cartography of desire|cartography of desire]]
		- start small - asking subscribers to send me their favorite memories in the city?
		- maybe i can still do this in nyc 
- zine
	- [[content/bloodline|bloodline]]
