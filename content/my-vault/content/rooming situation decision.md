title: "rooming situation decision"
---

Premise:
* Do I take this offer to sublet in Alphabet City from January - August, and room with three girls who i've worked before in community building activities? 
	* https://straightupjac.notion.site/Long-term-Sublet-in-East-Village-fefc43a822f34248b8df897f91a2765b?pvs=4
	* Girlie data: [Jaclyn C. | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaclynjac/)
		* [Daniela Velez | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielavelez/)
		* Context: met them through a coworking event they hold every sunday, take photos for their events, trying to involve myself more w their events 
* OR Do I not (aka stay in my parent's place / wait for another opportunity / wait until July to room with other friends)
	* Other options: 
		* HK for 2k with two cornellians (nicer room / living space, dont know the roomies, move in September)
		* Allison's friend's friend

What are my intentions of moving out of my parents apartment? 
* My goal was always to move out in fall - winter 2024 
	* I think the apartment has served its purpose: help me settle in nyc while I wait for my friends to settle in 
	* Out of scope but they dont want to move to NYC to retire any more so in a way they're keeping this apartment for me as I look for a new option 
	* **I want to live in a diff neighborhood and around other ppl so I can feel more interconnected w the city / word / less detached from life**
		* Latter part is a symptom of being a remote worker / generally transitioning to adulthood 
## Priorities
* I want roommates bc as someone whos been living alone and also a remote worker, I think im missing the baseline social interaction that I crave as an extrovert. And I work around this by coworking / filling up my 5-9 / etc. But I also want to try just having roommates to exist in this "shared air"
	* I REALLY want roomies who are also intent on hosting things for the apartment / outside, and who care about doing things for the sake of doing them 
	* Counter point: am i overindexing on the potential of fulfilling my adulthood loneliness by jumping into a roomie situation? 
* I also want to live in a place closer to friends that I can meet up with more spontaneously
	* like a more fun neighborhood. 
* Under <2.3K 
## Pros of this sublet:
* **Really good** roommate fit for my social & community goals*
	* Jaclyn has a ton of ideas for events a ton of events 
	* Daniela & Jaclyn both execute on their wacky ideas — silly hacks, cozy coworking, socratica
		* *so i trust that if they set out intentions, they will do it*
	* do i need to be roomies to help w this community engagement? no. but i cant see another way
		* counter: am i like jumping into a subpar housing situation bc these ppl r so cool? shouldn't i just try to proactively lead my own community/do some side projs to make me feel more in touch?
		* Am I over indexing on the promise of “community” vs concrete benefits? (Eg Verci) 
	* In a way i aspirationally believe im the sum of the ppl closest around me. i think living w ambitious / motivated ppl is super important for my own ambition / shocking me out of the complaceny i feel rn, BUT ofc thats a mindset thing that no outside intervention can fix
		* They also know a lot of ppl that I think would be cool to get to know but I can't also promise rooming w someone just cuz they have a wide network is a necessarily ethical/right thing to do 
* Cheapest price (1.9k) (within budget)
* Decent/fun location (10 minute from center of East Village, around a bunch of bars)*
* Close-ish to a running track (East River)
* Escape hatch: this sublet lasts until August, so if I want to move in with Michelle from Cornell I have more room to join her lease in July

## Cons  
* Inconvenient proximity to transportation:** 
	* 17 minutes to F, 15 minutes to L, 15 minutes to M15 Bus (which occurs pretty often)
		* Counterpoint: Jaclyn bikes to the Union Square station. Can I imagine doing this in the winter? 
	* Daily schedule
		* Coffee shops 
		* Gym 
		* Grocery store 
	* My weekly places I visit:
		* Midtown (for Microsoft office)
		* SoHo (Verci, various events)
		* Gramercy (hangs w Justin/Mahesh)
	* Infrequent visits (1-4x a month)
		* Long Island City (Jasmine, Sean)
* Smaller space
	* Room is on the smaller side, small living room for 4 girls to share, share one bathroom 
* My parents are pretty against this 
	* Not that this should matter as much as it does but my mom and sister are quite against it and dont believe i should compromise on my living situation for the potential upside of a roomie situation

# Projecting into the Future
## Best Case Scenario
* *This scenario is abstract bc the high upside I imagine is based on social/community/purpose happiness. This is me stepping out of my comfort zone. This is optimistic/dopamine driven.* 
* I get along rlly well with Daniela & Jaclyn. We become good friends and we proactively host things (dinner parties/hackathons/goal setting/etc) that are 0-friction for me to attend & host. 
	* There are externalities in being close to them (generally being closer to nyc tech community, being around ambitious girlies who can keep me accountable, have ppl who are always down for creative hobbies together)
* I am ok with the walk to transportation / get better at citibiking. 
* I am ok with the space I occupy in the apartment and satisfied with the cooking situation. 
* I enjoy living in East Village. I make use of the coffee shops (co-working, etc) and get to explore more of the neighborhood. It's easier for me to get to a friend's apartment. I go out to bars more often and enjoy this. 
## Worst Case Scenario
* *This scenario is concrete bc it's based on the facts of the apartment. This is me wishing I just stayed in my safe option. This is anxiety/fear driven.*
* We dont actually become close and I still feel lonely/lost. The promise of co-events / hanging falls through. 
* I move in January and the commute to a train station is painful cuz of weather & deters me from going out of the apartment. I feel further disatisfied. 
* I occupy a smaller space (living/common area wise) and that affects my productivity / comfort level as I also always have someone around. I get bothered by the co-hosted events as they infringe upon my own personal space.

## Ways to Mitigate Current Situation Cons
* "I feel lonely when I'm not proactively creating social situations" -> Go to Verci more often. Sign up for coworking situations that are closer (e.g. FiDi WeWork). Establish weekly coworking sessions with remote friends (e.g. Michelle)

## Ways to Mitigate New Situation Cons
* "The distance to the nearest train is high" -> Stay within East Village more (walk to local coffee shops). Citibike to the Union Square station. 
	* Feels similar to Copenhagen distance situation, without the space/quality
## Regret Minimization Framework
"Which decision will minimize regret?" 
* Aka will I always wonder what would happen if I had taken the rooming option with Jaclyn & Daniela? 
	* I can predict my living situation with my current apt. It's comfortable, convenient, spacious. The loneliness aspect I can mitigate with structuring my work day, and perhaps arises from a general frustration with the state of my career & slowness of my work that culminates in a lost sense of purpose. 
	* I cannot predict my living situation with this new apt. BUT it sounds super cool and without parental judgement / safety net I would be inclined to take it. Historically I do tend to make somewhat irrational decisions for the allure of the best-case scenario (e.g. transferring from CMU -> Cornell, choosing college to early, choosing to full-send PM) -- I generally operate with a regret minimization framework, face the consequences when it doesnt pan out, and eventually get over my living sitch. 
## Open Questions
1. The main draw for this living situation is the high quality roommates & potential upside of community building I can get. **Am I over-valuing this promise and will it empirically not deliver what i'm looking for** (bc I'm too busy post work, they're too busy during work, rooming situation breeds personal ire, we realistically just have separate lives that aren't open for integration, having people around is just not a solution for this deeper anxiety i feel)
2. **How much am I willing to budge in terms of transportation convenience?** Right now I live close to everything (1/2/3, 4/5/6, A/C/E, R/Q). So a lot of my life is escaping FiDi to go to different areas. This would be a different experience, spending more time within my neighborhood and having to really be intentional about the other places I go to. 
3. **Is living with 3 roomies more chaotic than I expect?** The shared area is decent, but given it's shared by 4 people, more cramped than 2-person situations I've seen. My room is ok, but also a little cramped. As a remote worker I do stay in my apartment 2-3 times a week. I cook probably 5-6 times a week. Is there a grocery store nearby? A gym? 
	1. Does the living space deter comfortable hangs from actually happening? Should I just try to host more in my own living space? 
4. **What is my risk tolerance and is this too big of a risk to jump?** I think I can vouch for the reliability of the girls. I'm not 100% sure how I'll feel about the location/commute. 
5. What can I do to help my due diligence?
	1. Grabbing time with Daniela to get to know her better
	2. Could grab time with Jaclyn
	3. Sister suggested I sublet for a week and see how it feels to live there
6. **Do I think there will be a good roommate fit AND a better living situation before January?**
	1. I do have roomie options but I think I would rather live by myself than with a roomie I wont be close with (which is such a privileged thing to say!!) A lot of ppl also live far from places (e.g. Stepho/Taylor live far from train station, etc, Bahar in UES, ppl who live in Brooklyn, etc)
	2. I don't believe Ill get an offer from ppl who I look up to as much as these two girls BUT i dont know if thats necessary for a rooming situation
	3. In any case: rejecting this apartment is **not necessarily saying I will be solo until July.** It's just waiting for a living situation that fits better in 1) distance to trains or 2) living space, while accepting I can't guarantee *living* with someoen i know already / want to live with

General notes (aka brain dump)

The alternatives 
Questions to ask 
* can I ask for more time? 
* What would more time give me ? 
* Things that I’m not sure within my scope: 
* if I move out parents will sell nyc apartment so it lowkey feels like they o lt hold onto it for me

can i try living for a week and then sublet 
give this a try before committing


post angela call:
(important points: shes pretty antisocial and protective of her working space)
* heavily implied that trying to get roommates to lifehack community/socialness is over-optimistic bc empirically ppl dont hang too much in their apartment
* and that 
possible action items:
* could ask them if i could trial-run living there for a week and then decide whether to commit


why do i actually want to move out?
* i miss having a roommate to go home to who 
	* is it fomo? i cant guarantee that with roommates
	* but i also tend to be more successful than not in cultivating this with my roommates

what is the best case scenario?
* i rlly enjoy living in east village bc its where a lot of bars and people are around
	* who do i know in east village ? that i would hit up??? um 
* 
what is the worst case scenario?
* i feel suffocated bc i have less personal space and limited common room space
	* 
* i stay at home more bc the train lines are so inconvenient and im scared to bike (esp in the winter)
	* precedent from copenhagen tbh 
	* can i just learn to be a better biker?  
* i feel like i


what is my ideal roommate situation?
* closer to a train line

what do i currently do in nyc?
* i do a lot of coworking / working out of cafes
* frequent (a few times a week): gramercy park (mahesh/justin), microsoft office (midtown), soho (verci, work out
* fill up my 5-9 with stuff to do 
	* every night last week i had something to do
	* (so realistically will i hang out w roommates that much??)

my biases:
1. adult loneliness
	1. i wouldnt say im lonely. but i also think there's a bit of unease i feel without having someone around me 80% of the day?
