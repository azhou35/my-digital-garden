title: "early jan 25 journal entry"
---

snapshot:
- 1 week into code red security patch (996)
- post-all day hang w vinny / jess 
- 2-3 months post-moving to sf

ugh yk it's one of those days where theres so many things going on but also good convos being had & undeniable self learnings and you realize you just HAVE to sit down and write your thoughts out
bc this is a transient precious moment in time
yeah. this is one of those days

heart is full
this week i discovered purpose (which is =/= meaning, aka your Grand Quest of Life)

social events:
- sat night
	- comma capital
		- lame 
	- andrews office warming
		- lame
	- spontaneous din w cat z and aaryan
		- cat's eternal self-comparison game, calling me approachable v her unapproachable, her talking constantly about boys/dating 
			- i feel weird bc she is a foil of me and i want to be like her but i also dont enoy her life bc she projects on me
				- she has the baddie aesthetic i want - tight black dress, black mascara, white nails, silver jewelry
	
			- surprised to learn she is second gen based on how angsty she is
				- her quest is rlly how do i make a $ the same way my mom did 
				- my quest is how do i make my parent's immigration to china worth it
					- this is related to my eternal existentialism on living up to my potential and carrying the baton of my father 
				- i enjoy her comment about my writing but it comes off kilter bc theyre deeply personal thoughts
			- i like how aaryan asked how much would u get paid to kill someone 
			- or if u could do one crime to make sure no one would ever suffer that crime what would u do
			- so glad i didnt take peregrine it sounds terrible
				- cat actively looking at abuse files etc
		- very machievalliean esque
		- aaryan being the constant "prankster" as he self-refers himself
		- its an odd trio, diff selves of me are brought out w them individually, so i dont know how to act w them together 
	- post hang i work and pass out
- sun
	- morning take caltrain w vinny while hes reading severance and the sun is shining on him 
		- im complaining about work and giving him the high level
		- hes reading severance which i told him about and dragged him to ling ma
		- he has good questions about the client relationship we have 
		- in front of stadium i tell him my goal is to pay more attention to my style, beauty, skincare, hair aka fundamenals 
		- he also has a similar style glowup goal 
			- describes my style as very "tech"
		- his sister flo buys a lot of clothes, spends 1 hr before school to get ready and film 
			- cycles thru so many clothes
			- i think i care about form-function fit 
	- hockey!
		- lots of thoughts about sports again
		- i think it's a really elegant sport when they move
			- less so when they try to act
				- bc the hockey is an extension of self and its not a fully controllable limb 
			- itd be so cool to do like an animation representing hockey players on the rink bc they are constantly moving around a central midpoint
			- they dont score as much here
			- the puck kinda goes crazy, less precise
			- not as violent as i thought it would be (aka cornell)
		- the word of the day is zamboni
		- there's a spectrum on how easy a sport is to watch with little context of the sport
			- e.g. baseball is on the max: hard to watch w o context
				- its like reading a calculus book without arithmetic
			- hockey is relatively easy to watch
				- u shoot puck into goal
			- basketball has some nuance and elegance
			- football surprisingly so
		- im circulating a lot of thoughts around sports, should write about it some time
	- btw sooo many sharks fans even tho theyre bad 
		- many smols w jerseys
	- im very impatient - when we were trying to get out of the food place vinny and jess dithered while i just pushed past ppl
		- eg when we were leaving dinner and checking caltrain i started walking
		- always gotta be moving / multitasking
- nails
	- such good girlie convo w jess
	- on style / hair
		- she uses straightener to straighten down top of hair and curl in
		- she wants to be more scandi chic while i wanna be more y2k 
		- she used to try hard in work but its a matter of
			- why if everyone is not trying hard in style
				- girls overthink this lol
	- we talk about work
		- everytime we talk about work i am constrained in my advice just bc she inherits a very traditional mindset on success (leetcode, tech job, bootcamps) whereas i operate on a different abstraction
			- she sees job x and thinks "what skills do i need to do this"
			- i see job x and think "what will i learn on the job"
				- i learn via projects/reading
	- she asks what i learned recently
		- talk about breakneck:
			- engineering vs lawyerly state 
			- manufacturing power vs tech/finance power
			- are you really free?
				- in america chained to big business
				- in china chained to .. policy / government 
		- i want to read more geopolitical stuff
			- she asked me what i wanna read and i buffered. i need a good go to for "what have i read recently / want to read"
- dinner
	- valley goat - same as girl and goat and i didnt realize
		- very warm ambiance, felt like i was in a farm, wooden 
		- lots of smol goats - count the number of goods 
	- so good! 
	- new american food w asian influence
		- eg pork shank w bossam vibes
	- questions like
		- why are there no michelin star chinese restaurants
			- obv answer: there's an inherent price ceiling for our willingness to pay for chinese food vs japanese
				- my counter: fine mexican / latam exists despite cheap perceptions 
			- my answer: textural differences / fine dining takes an ingredient and isolates an element and puts a spin, hard to isolate elments of chinese food like soysauce
				- vinnys counter: spicy food 
					- my counter - michelin doesnt rlly like spicy
			- why dont we have a restaurant w the regional specialty across china ? 
			- jess - from guangdi, lots of suancai, ru luo shi aka snail noodles
			- vinny - wuzhounese, by port 
		- what is a compliment u get that u rlly appreciate
			- jess: funny
			- annie: mature/funny/good writer 
				- i want more ppl to say im smart
			- vinny: good friend, i rly appreciate u, ur easy to talk to 
			- generally: good taste
				- reflection: prob the compliment that you have good friends
		- family traditions
			- vinny showed us his family christmas and it was so cute
				- flo jsut does things - 
					- bought reindeer ears
					- matching sweaters
					- played game where they grab cash
					- gets cupcakes from wechat
				- his dad lowkey makes rlly good food 
					- also cares about protein lmao 
					- like my dad
			- jess's mom also makes good food
		- if ur partner gave feedback on appearance would u take it srsl
			- me - yes but the hair thing is stupid
				- but also i ask nitin to shave
				- but also he asks me to buy clothes i dont like
			- vinny - no 
		- board games
			- vinny playing chinese poker
		- ugh theres def something here about owning property in china and playing games and risk and reward and tradeoff and payoff and gambling
	- overall so happy and so grateful to have friends u can talk endlessly w - taxicub theory
- train back from caltrain
	- i love vinny but hes a little slow and im impatient
	- khoi/justin double book melt down
	- i tell him a loottt about my work reflections
	- i realze vinny is so easy to vent to. i dunno how when im w him the self analysis and the self therapizing rlly comes out in a way it doesnt w other friends 
	- more work reflectoins later but loosely considering -
	- perception of myself in work
		- confidence/making a call
		- being slow at operational work (etc excel/terminal)
			- making mistakes
			- his suggestion:
				- make checklists
				- double triple check 
				- set up good systems
				- reference old work for formulas
			- so many things like sensitive info that he is mindful of
		- as someone early in career ur the bottom of barrel eat shit kinda type
			- eg at azure id do the grunt spreadsheet making work for aditya
			- batch usage data for mitra
				- passed onto me by caro 
				- which i pass onto anthony
			- my realization on excel: its rlly hard to operate other ppls excels without doing it urself first
	- vinny's q: can u imagine urself as kenny by age 30
		- shoudl i tell kenny straight lmao thats the metric that i used to choose my job
			- im very impressed by how he stepped up and pushed back on azure
		- my answer was yes
			- he was like what about kids?
			- ugh rabbit hole about nitin wanting kids before me 
		- for as long as i can keep pushing i will keep going

### job reflections 1-11-2026
- q1 rly sm more chaotic than fall/winter
	- shoulda done my moving shit last month lmao
- sev-nvidia-maintenances
	- good vis program 
	- helps me see the bigger picture of tpm
		- ur running an inherently risky operation that requires cooperation and coordination and processes 
			- and every time two things clash there's inherent friction and fallout 
				- no one knows how system x interacts w system y when mechanism z is introduced
				- eg unclear consequence of these maintenances to 
					- scheduling system
						- a lot of my priors were broken and i had to reevaluate / reassess
				- **TO DO:** document and diagram this effect / system
					- eg saagar didnt rlly know what consequences there are
			- you have to make calls knowing 80% of the info 
				- and accept the consequence
			- but also loop in the right stakeholders to make an informed decision OR to get their buy-in/sign off/cover ur ass
				- eg rpms/research
		- tpm is about **picking and choosing ur risk** so you **make decisions** that lead **towards an outcome**
			- there is no riskless decision u just gotta do it sometimes
			- diff ppl have diff opinions of risk based on their pov/sme 
			- u have to make a call for the greater good (utilitarianism)
	- negotiation
		- good to be in lockstep, good to call out bullshit
		- so glad im not at azure where theyre throwing bodies at the problem
		- remember to call out what processes/systems they should build to make this easier next time
- overall this was a rlly good highlevel crashcourse into the company
	- weeds of scheduling system
	- working w clusters team
	- less so hwh even tho we own the maintenance controller
		- good reflection point w eri where we talked about protecting boundaries, how to make this less toilsome
- maintenance
	- should not be this painful / handholdy 
	- ppl have averse reaction to maintenance
		- low trust
		- its like a bite the bullet and pray
		- how do i derisk maintenances so its less of a operational burden? 
			- that ppl dont respond w guh
			- that ppl dont fear on call
		- ideally it should
			- go in the bg
			- have minimal impact
			- overcommunicate w ample downtime
				- not human led, system led
		- we need control plane for
			- customer
				- vis 
				- tracking
				- updates
	- i should not need to defer on other csps (nad make their slas/work harder) just to lock in on this 
		- much like we call out azure for lack of resource i call myself out for being resource constrained
		- resource constraint should not be exposed to partners - u should manage expectations b4 hand
- level of abstractions of convos
	- how granular / fine they need to be
	- vs high level 
- lot of respect for fleet/oai
	- we can rally / go to war - first real exp
	- ppl also proactively check in on u / other teammates re burnout bc theyve experienced burnout 
		- eg kenny offering to take on work
		- eri taking on sujiths work 
		- vansh looking out for eri 
	- u can trust ppl to self mobilize
		- give them an outcome and they will figure out the right steps - just make sure u get the right ppl
			- its cool bc incentives are aligned 
			- theres some algorithmic corollarly here like recursive
			- maybe it's like agents?
			- chat suggests:
				- stochastic, decentralized gradient descent
				- many agents (resources/sres)
				- one objective function (resolve the incident)
				- Each agent has partial local information
				- Agents act **independently and in parallel**
				- They communicate deltas (“hey I fixed X”, “Y is blocked”, “Z is now healthy”)
		- ppl will always take u seriously / treat things w stakes here no matter how busy 
		- v slack responsive culture
- i like tpm! 
	- i like coordinating ppl 
		- nudging them towards right outcome
	- i like working towards the best outcome w all the inputs
	- i like being a master of all, jack of none 
		- tech-wise: excel, terminal, using tools like zoku/engine manager, maybe cursor/web development, snowflake/db 
	- i like how it's technical but also a ppl problem but also a systems problem 
	- i like how its highly vis
	- defining signals, driving action, optimizing and being efficient
		- i should study control theory
- i dont like tpm
	- i dont like comms 
	- its lots of operational work esp at scale
	- u have to context switch sm 
	- only u hold all the cards and u reveal info to ppl selectively / thoughtfully 
	- it can be thankless 
		- devs r actively dirving out work 
- i like maintenance
	- i like how its highly vis and touches all parts of the company
	- obv have a lot of context
	- its an easy ramp given my jnr level
- i dont like maintenance
	- i want to automate my job away and rely on a system rather than runbooks
	- its hard to have net-new wins
		- e.g. maintenance in construction projs is considered a cost
		- so ur mindset is always cost-cuttin
		- humans are loss-averse
		- i want projs/to eventually do something that is a growth leader 
			- e.g. yacoub bringing up cluster bring ups
			- no one would ever be like - yay we did 300k maintenances!
				- but wed celebrate 1M GPUs
				- my metrics are:
					1.  reliability 
					2. healthiness
					3. minimize toil
				- to do 3, the easy short-term metric is to jsut defer/push out maintenance 
					- but there's a hidden "deferred maintenance cost" /maintenance debt 
						- that long-term violates #1 and #2 
			- i need some better metrics - or at least hit some baseline so there's metrics for 'growth' or 'outcomes here'
		- **ig the net-new work are tools/systems to build to make this easier**
	- what i learned
		- schedule send
		- formulas for excel 
		- pushing back 
		- its ok for me not to own things
			- eg running applied cordon shouldnt be something im expected to go to terminal and be faster at
			- lower leverage to wrangle terminal/perms compared to 
				- pushing for maintenance controller
- my strengths
	- i pick up things easily
	- im willing to learn
- my weaknesses
	- lack of confidence
	- sometimes i dither




shortlist of maintenance improvements:
- execution
	- maintenance controller
		- pre maintenance
			- button to scale in/scale out 
			- button cordon/rma
			- automatic signals from csp<>fleet
		- during maintenance
			- show progress of maintenance via dashboard OR eta tbh
				- data/kusto/messages from CSPs
			- show comms to users in terms of when to expect capacity 
		- post maintenance
			- hwh recovery 
			- drive support cases w csp 
				- set slas for recovery
			- 
- comms
	- research
		- automate fleet notifier 
			- as soon as maintenance is scheduled and confirmed: 
				- notify 1 week before
				- <5 day before
				- <1 day before
				- <24 hr before
			- false negatives is worse than false positives
				- “It’s better to accidentally notify someone when nothing ends up happening than to fail to notify someone when maintenance does happen.”
					- bias towards recall
						- redundant recall amplification by spamming
					- safety critical alerting logic
	- applied
		- automate peter's/simon's script for comms
		- document signals for scheduling behavior 
		- honestly automate messages to simont/model scheduler on call
	- i need some better channel compared to slack pings
		- ppl r overloaded w pings
		- maybe go/next research channel
		- maybe specific #.maintenancealerts channel
			- side note i pick up well on linguistic quirks

- risks
- some theories / philosophies to learn from
	- control theory
	- risk communication
	- user experience 
	- infra / maintenance
	- network / systems theory

general social reflections:
- ive been more spontaneous in terms of extending / accepting hangs bc i have more time 
- i rlly enjoy hanging w vinny and jess
	- endlessly generative
	- i can tell them about the rlly stupid thots ive been chewing on esp wrt style
	- theyre just caring ppl, vinny bought us pastries and coffee 
	- at dinner we always have good thought experiments or questions 
- ugh even hto i didnt socialize during week i rlly happy i did bc i come alive in these hangs
