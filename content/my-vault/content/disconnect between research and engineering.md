title: "disconnect between research and engineering"
---

having read the idea factory recently, it's rare to see research output drive technological "innovation".

the dot com age meant that we found problems and engineered solutions.

in this day and age, research is again reclaiming the throne as the driver for output. we find the largest amounts of compute and refine our training workloads and see what sort of new capabilities fall out. 

ideas vs execution - silicon valley is so pressed on building. building is the bottleneck and it outpaces research.

e.g. interpretability: this is long-seeded research. as gpts out-paced this research we are left retro-actively considering the [urgency of interpretability.]([Dario Amodei — The Urgency of Interpretability](https://www.darioamodei.com/post/the-urgency-of-interpretability))
