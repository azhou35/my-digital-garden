title: "flushing food courts"
---

steam billows from the metal baskets, clouding the window of shanghai you yuan. the flushing streets pulse with afternoon crowds. nothing fazes my mother, as her voice cuts through the din - her mandarin smooth and assertive as she haggles for shengjianbao at the counter. 

here, she transforms.

she says she feels like *如鱼得水,* like a fish in water, a mantra that guides her confident passage through through the thick of new world mall's basement food courts. well consider me a fish indeed, my mouth agape and eyes bugging at the chaos before me. these types of food courts are a hop away from the sleek manhattan markets that usually occupy my weekends. here, communal tables are not just for eating. you brush shoulders with local kids using one hand to drawl math equations in between bites of dumplings. fogged-up frames slip off the low nose bridge of a lone high schooler as he scarfs down a bowl of noodles. 

there are aunties packaging pig trotters and toddlers running around and fooling with the shopkeepers. this is a not a food court but a community space. a day care. these spaces emerged from necessity and adaptation. in the 80s, as manhattan's chinatown grew increasingly expensive and expensive, chinese immigrants saw opportunity in flushing. these entrepreneurs began converting old retail spaces into food halls - a practical choice to cut expenses with low overhead costs for vendors and shared seating. in the process, they accidentally recreated the communal atmosphere of asia's street markets. 

my parent's journey in america began a stone's throw away from flushing. after immigrating from china in the late 80s, their first landing zone was manhattan, and they raised their eldest daughter in forest hills. they'd shuttle her to dance classes, load up on dumplings at White Bear, pick up malaxianguo from the food courts. 

but I grew up in a different universe: Central Jersey, where culture meant fake tans and Italian women with over-gelled hair. at our local mall the only Chinese option was Panda Express - in some counterproductive act of rebellion, I begged for taco bell instead. no shared tables, only individual booths. We found our rhythm through weeknight stops at the Italian grocer, weekend trips to seafood festivals. while i yawned and groaned through chinese school, my parents practiced their English on orders of rigatoni and lobster rolls. in doing so, they traded the comfort of community for the comfort of control. 

it's a calculation instinctive to immigrants: cultural belonging versus their children's opportunity. *new jersey was the best place to raise you,* and they say it so often i almost believe it. with every move they made they went further from their roots and closer to the american dream. manicured lawns and strip malls and vehicular freedom.

shanghai, i stood in a six-story mall food court, watching a robot glide between pristine tables with a tray of bubble tea. in this foreign utopia you can't pay with card, let alone cash - every transaction is via WeChat Pay. with rows and rows of clean food stalls and pristine polished tables, the food courts here exude efficiency. the air smelled of nothing, a stark contrast from the constant smog of air pollution outside.

skyscraper shopping malls have surmounted an old playground, the xiao chi stands have turned into third wave cafes. the city has moved along. in the past ten years a dizzying array of mega buildings have struck shanghai's skyline, and many buildings have a feeling of being new but unused. spaces that arise out of design instead of necessity carry a special emptiness to them. when it's almost too easy to find a seat at the food court, they lose the human messiness that makes them feel alive. isn't it funny, the fronts we design as masks that hide our true selves?

authenticity has become a platitude. where can i find the *real* image of our chinese culture? is it a fading facade in manhattan chinatown, or shanghai that's full-thrusted ahead? within memories of flushing food courts or realities in a suburban jersey home?

i admit - i turned down every chance to visit flushing in high school or college. so my visit last december was the first time in a near-decade. a memory coming alive feels like a dream sequences - your dreams starts *in media res* and you always ask - how did i get here? 

there's a new hot spot in flushing now, tangram mall, a behemoth boasting glass skylights and shiny gatcha machines and floors so shiny you see your own reflection follow you. that biting cold day dad showed me a video of a fancy afternoon tea place from his xiao hong shu, suggesting we go there instead of our usual haunts. i insisted we go to new world mall, for the nostalgia and rawness it feels. but standing witness to the chaos of the basement, i understand: 

new world mall seems less of a portal to china today, and more of a time capsule of china of another generation - the nostalgia and memories that 70s immigrants brought with them across the Atlantic Ocean. this shrine is to a china which has since moved on. my parents traded their own comfort for mine, marboro’s manicured picket fence lawns over flushing’s bustling streets, more in line with the American picket fence dream. is this reality? tension thickens when we walk the tightrope of compression and preservation. 





in shanghai, the elevator spits me out on the fifth floor. 
time last year i visited shanghai in search of the source material. but the food courts that i found came out of a utopia: hosted in malls that towered six floors high, with rows and rows of clean restaurants with robots as servers and payment by phone as the norm. sleek, shiny, but sterile and unused. modern food courts are efficient but lost the human messiness that made them feel alive. when spaces get too polished they lose that vital energy of survival and community: how ppl squeeze tg at tables, shouting orders, quick calculations. there are no messy idisonsyncratic chinese signs. 








themes:
* how do we flatten a culture in our attempts to preserve it? 
* - The immigrant parent's sacrifice of community for opportunity
* community spaces out of necessity
when they moved to new jersey, their flushing trips became rare pilgrimages. the drive theoretically took one hour but in practice took two, thanks to the congestion built up on the dqbr. i mercilessly complained about the commute on the way there, but i'd always forget about it when we reached our destination and i stumbled around the streets in search of the source of all the yummy smells. *this place is great. why didn't we stay?* from the look on their faces i could tell this was a question they have definitely considered. my parents often justify their move to me, explaining that New York was no place to raise a child.
