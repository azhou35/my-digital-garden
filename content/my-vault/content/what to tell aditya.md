i joined scale dsy

its been raining so badly 

I wanted to talk through something important with you. i really see you as my mentor here and ever since my internship ive always trusted you to steer me in the right direction regardless if thats at microsoft or not
yk i always wanted to work at a startup as early in my career as possible
I've been talking to Scale AI, and they've given me a TPM offer that I need to respond to soon. at the moment im leaning towards it but Before I make this decision, i wanted to let you know as soon as possible and also hear your perspective on whats right to do



(pause here, allow him to react)


**Explain the role:** "

i got inbound from scale a month ago 
The role is building AI evaluation products - defining what evals mean from a product perspective and shipping features that determine how AI systems get validated. I'd still be working with the major labs, but from the product side."

**Address timing directly:** "I have a lot of guilt about this timing. I know we have so much on the roadmap, and this is coming right when I'm moving to work directly with you. I even asked them if I could start in a few months, but the offer is contingent on joining soon."

**Why you're considering it:** "It feels like a chance to develop product skills I can't get elsewhere - shipping features, defining strategy, learning exponentially in a fast-paced environment. Plus theres an in-person aspect based in NYC."

**Close with seeking advice:** "the ability and trust to get promoted early at microsoft is incredible, and the OAI work has taught me so much. But Im leaning towards taking this offer  - wanted to hear your honest take - what do you think?"

**but the offer is contingent on me joining asap** 
and its put me in a rlly tough spot 
where i do feel the draw to learn as mcuh as possible as soon as possible, in an environment that is going to push me 

I've been really excited about the opportunity to work directly under your management. This isn't about avoiding that - it's about a specific role that aligns with my product development goals
realize this affects your planning for the team structure and upcoming projects. If I do decide to take this, I want to make sure we have a solid transition plan.

if yuo asked me a couple of months ago i would have taken it in a heartbeat, back in november i was still very unmotivated by work
