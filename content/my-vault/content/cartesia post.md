title: "cartesia post"

so much of my writing depends on my inner voice.

sometimes, the words leap off the page. sometimes, written word isn't enough. 

i've been playing with cartesia's narration feature to bring my substack articles to life - 

& it's accelerated the time it would take normally to record a voice over & it's helped me explore adding depth with quotes in my writing. 

tried out the voiceover on my piece on flushing and family, check it out here! [(1) flushing food courts & facades - by anniething & anniewhere](https://anniewhere.substack.com/p/flushing-and-facades)
