Cities have evolved in tandem with text and image-based information systems designed to help overwhelmed residents choose among competing options for consumption. To take one example, annual publications of business information like the Yellow Pages have existed since the 1880s. But digital technology adds unprecedented speed and precision to this process. Today, companies like Foursquare, Yelp, and TripAdvisor offer continuously updated lists of businesses and attractions with extraordinary specificity.

But there’s a crucial distinction: whereas Google’s crawling is automated, Foursquare’s is performed by actual humans—a fact that LBS companies tend to downplay. A lot of the hype around urban information systems centers on “artificial intelligence”: the ability for companies like Foursquare to seamlessly guide you to relevant places and products. But as danah boyd and Kate Crawford, among others, have pointed out regarding “big data” more broadly, these apps actually derive their value from a vast stockpile of human labor.

And, as with any labor pool, some workers are more valuable than others. Certain Foursquare users are more passive in their interactions with the app; others actively contribute ratings and reviews, and check in to new businesses using Foursquare’s “lifelogging” app Swarm to keep the company’s data current. According to Foursquare’s own promotional material, this population of “superusers” is only 43,000. But this relatively small cohort, performing what Tiziana Terranova calls the “free labor” undergirding the online economy, produces a large portion of the company’s value.

Crawling the city is lucrative for technology companies, the real estate industry, and other beneficiaries of gentrification. But what happens when the users who crawl the city can no longer afford to live there? What happens when services like Foursquare and Yelp lose their labor supply?

The long-term profitability of these companies is threatened by the growing impoverishment of their key user base: urban millennials. Squeezed by stagnant wage growth and sky-high housing prices, both lambasted for their thrift and shamed for small indulgences like avocado toast, this cohort’s ability to generate new data and justify advertising campaigns is crucial to the location data economy. And while LBS founders and investors skew predictably straight, white, and male, prolific Yelp users in cities like New York and San Francisco are more likely to identify as female and Asian-American, facing a double bind of discrimination despite educational credentials well above average.

Like Felsenstein said in his reflections on the Community Memory Project==, I still believe that the internet is a hospitable territory, even for those of us who believe in the magic of the city. Sustaining these online communities locally is still probably harder than it is to build more dispersed networks, and the draw of the latter is as strong as ever. But if we are willing to try, we might just discover abundance in the places that have been alive all the while.==
