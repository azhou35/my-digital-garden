graph learning has evolved from traditional graph theoretic approaches to more complex (approximate) message-passing and graph embedding techniques

Techniques exploiting deep learning on KGs will become more critical as enterprises become pressed to represent/develop knowledge layers across/between their organizations—integrating human-generated content and semantic layers on top of various enterprise technologies and APIs. These systems will provide natural human interfaces (i.e. question-answering), which will understand both human context and intent.
