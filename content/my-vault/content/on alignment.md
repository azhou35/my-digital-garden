title: "on alignment"
---


_The philosopher Kwame Appiah writes that “in life, the challenge is not so much to figure out how best to play the game; the challenge is to figure out what game you’re playing.”_

in chinese school i signed up to play chess. in my abc-ignorance i signed up for go instead. with two players and black and white pieces, its visual similarities belie a philosophical difference. 

while chess centers around collecting different pieces of the opposite color, go is fundamentally different: while you get points for how many opponent pieces you "capture," you can also receive points for the type of structure you build. the whole premise is on building a beautiful structure, aside from mere conquest. 

i hated go, because i would often win skirmishes and ultimately lose at the end. how do i know i'm ahead?

we like gameboards where the score is easily legible. when you know who's winning someone could look at your linkedin and socials and clock if you're winning. 

maybe this is why the consumer economy is such a natural formula to fall into. consumers have a scarce resource (time, money, attention) in exchange for "goods" - often, content. 

but this attention-farming game is disatisfying to me. the transactional nature of friendships

#### prestige is a finite game

*do I want it or do I want people to know I have it?*

the reason why a lot of us in our 20s feel unfulfilled is because we're tired of chasing the prestige game. i catch up with s and j for monthly read-outs on i-banking and consulting and their toxic work environments. 

is a promotion worth it without respect? are benefits any meaning without freedom? 

[[https://www.sherryning.com/p/youre-overspending-because-you-lack-values|all desire is a desire for being. ]]in 2025 i had this undeniable yearning

i'll be honest: i'm a prestige whore. in eugene wei's piece on social media they all amplify different vices and substack tickles a particular itch: the desire to be seen as intellectual. 

it's hard to ignore the numbers, the hit of getting a job other people are jealous of. 

frame prestige chasing as a finite, mimetic loop versus an infinite game of actually liking/using the thing

i want to stop playing this game. 
### on career 

a career is long and it isnt just the programs you guide or the features you ship. 

alignment and incentive matching is what you need in order to build positive feedback loops. 

for the larger part of 2025 my career was misaligned with my own values. and i convinced myself i could live separate lives, like severance, where 

different games in our life: finding the next job, dating, housing. i ask friends for referrals for jobs the same way they ask me for friends to match them with, or i've asked them for roommates. 

 *I’ve heard this described before as “playing the right game,” or “climbing the right ladder,” but I think it’s about more than that. I think it’s about finding the things that light you up inside so much that you can’t help but dive in and do things you are wildly proud of.*
 
“The best color in the whole world is the one that looks good on you.”–Coco Chanel

when you live an aligned life everything matches up.

### on friends 

"All right, penultimate question. You have one of your frameworks, or aphorisms, that is: optimize for alignment, not outcomes. You go on to say: if success is defined over long periods of time, the best way to ensure consistent collaboration between parties is to spend time on alignment. Outcomes are an output of the execution ability of the group, not an input. This is why value systems, manifestos, etc. are core to long-term business and professional relationships." - [Chris Paik on Dialectic](https://jacksondahl.com/dialectic/chris-paik#Alignment%20with%20Keely%20in%20life%20and%20Jordan%20at%20Pace%20[01%2051%2036]) (lol) 

The natural corollary is that it's less important to perfectly align with your community / larger friend groups. Everyone should share values and a desire to care - these are important but nontrivial filters - but for community-building, we abstract our individual selves and instead align with a common _ethos._ The ethos should be a sum of our values, but it won't directly map onto our individual motivations, and sometimes that ethos is as simple as _I care about this friend group and I will show up, over and over again._ I think my common struggle is finding these types of people. Many people are open-minded (i.e. will try new hobbies, new restaurants, show up to wacky events, etc) but very few people have the _audacity to care._

Anything is possible aligning goals and people, and yet everything feels impossible when things are misaligned - even if they are meaningful pursuits in themselves. Our job is to build alignment from the ground up I guess, in everything that we do. Real agency is not just "doing things" or "trying things" - it's building and committing to things esp when they are hard.

"but it is important to note that curating your milieu isn't only or even primarily about being picky. it is about how you relate to people."

im searhcing some platonic ideal of everything: food, people, passions.

friendship is another dimension where resonance makes all the difference. in an coastal city it's fairly easy to find people who are fuzzy matches to your personality, because the location attracts generally open-minded yuppies. 

but it takes time and intention to cultivate a close group of people who are aligned with your values - aka people who just *get it*. i find that the friends who stick share some common qualities: a shared notion of generosity, a sharp wit. it helps to have friends who like to host and are biased to hang, because some how the barrier to meeting up with people is this ability to just hang. 

when you find the right people, the relational energy between you creates emergent properties. 
#### to become oneself

i can't do hard things. the prospect of 80-hour workdays in ib baffle me, the same way a cold plunge or 5 am wake ups do.

i can't do easy things, either. i can't sit still and *tang ping* as much as i wish i could.
i thrive at some messy middle: where it's just challenging enough to feel rigor, but doable enough that i'm not discouraged.
