“**Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es**”
"Tell me what you eat and I will tell you who you are" - French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Saravin
Though taste may appear effortless, you can’t have taste by mistake. It requires intention, focus, and care. Taste is a commitment to a state of attention.  It’s a process of peeling back layer after layer, turning over rock after rock. As John Saltivier says in [an essay](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail) about building a set of stairs, “surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality.”
notes on taste:
- people develop taste within a vacuum 
	- what do they want others to think of them 
	- what do they personally bring them joy
- im less criticalabout the outcome, more about the framework w which you review the food
	- i will not claim to be n expert gastronome but im very interested in the context in which a food is prepared
	- cheap tricks like comments on price without accounting for price/value 
- extends beyond food -> being intentional about what you consume
	- youtube trend where you eat / buy whatever the algo recommends
- it's about the framework:
	- To discern is not to distinguish the difference between good and bad, it is the difference between good versus great.
	- good is replicable by ai and amateurs
	- great pushes the boundaries bc you understand the rules and expand beyond it
culinary class wars observations:
* fusion for the sake of fusion
* taste goes back to inherent classicism
	* the lower class idolizes that of the upper class and aims to imitate. we must leapfrog the current trends as by the time you get to replicate it, it's become out of vogue 
	* upper class idolizes artifacts of the lower class -
* true taste cannot be mimetic lest you risk going out of style soon
