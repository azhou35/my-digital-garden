* created : my substack 
	* 500 subscribers
When I left college a year early, I embarked on a self-proclaimed "liminal space" -- one where I would be travelling and exploring on my own in anticipation of starting my full time job. I've always been trying to find my *meaning*, as abstract as it may be. 
I started a blog exploring my identity and my draw towards creativity. Having deleted all socials during this period, this blog was my lifeline to my friends back home -- and it soon became a reminder of myself as I changed contexts from all the travels I did. 
When I moved to New York, I found an audience who resonated with my writing. Writing became a way for me to connect with new people, inciting conversation on what they thought about. People commented that the vulnerability with which I wrote encouraged them to open up as well. A childhood friend started their own blog.

thinnk intentionally about the space i create for my community
Started a regular reading club for the new technologists i met in nyc 


	* more importantly, its pulled a gravity of people whose perspectives i truly trust
	* substack spun out a way to catalog my experiences during my early graduation from college -- and ended up as a source of gravity that drew in meaningful convos with friends, new friends, etc
	* proud -- lit up my writing to thought people i look up to 
	* ability to write on it regularly 
* its part of a long time writing practice
* springboard to create thoughtful conversations in my local communities
	* find other technologists who wanted todiscuss the state of progress
	* writing clubs, socratic seminars
	* created a localized english class 
	* rewarding to see the thoughts behind my technologist friends
* accomplished:
* turn meaning-making from an individual, rational pursuit to a community 
Find a community that is also asking these questions. Americans have largely been taught to solve age-old questions of value and meaning individually, to figure out everything rationally, to decide about information and authority figures piecemeal. Being forced to solve everything anew as an autonomous (read: lonely) rational agent results in increased guilt, overwhelm, and uncertainty.4 You could join a community like [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/) or [the Bento Society](https://bentoism.org/about), explore your local faith communities, or join a community of technologists thinking about these questions like [Interact](https://joininteract.com/).
