tech opportunities
1) multimodality
2) proactivitiy 
3) personalization / context 
we can think about opportunities in two ways
- sierra's and the customers
here is what matters the customer 
- pre purchase 
- usage
- post purchase

what are the business use cases we enable

at the end state what does Sierra enable the customer to do 
what does human computer interaction 
1) first thing is multmodality and how sierra can exist in voice / text
2) productivity 
	1) if theyre loticing low engagemnet, sierra can reach out to ecustomers
	2) if it notices high engagemnet it can upsell
	3) it can serve up the right one 
3) customization 
	1) sierra exists as 
	2) bc the agents for each vertical and company are slightly differet 
	3) we can believe somtehing that truly feels custom for that user in how they interface
	4) so for travel, its remembering the traveler's known traveller number 
	5) ad is aware this is a business customer who flies from nyc
	6) things like that are what creates customer delight
	7) contextual & personalized customer experience is what causes jaw dropping customer experiences

decision
1) what is ur lean s
	1) pick top three
2) what is the timeline of scoping this out 
3) once we have proof of concepts how do we evaluate
4) once u pick that, how do we build that out 
what is the outcome here and how do we price based off that outcome 


Evaluation 
- now these depend on the vertical and not absolutely correct but this would be customized for hwatever the business is 
	- but generally rewards is tough to track but dont super help the business relative to toherthings
