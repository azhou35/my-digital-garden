today is actually like crack in terms of weather 
product philosopher =/= builder
startups are looking for executors, not deep thinkers 
need actionable small steps - 
goal is to create some sort of strava data visualization this week
creating frameworks and plans are just ways to feel productiv ewithout actually achieving anything 
in cornell i really face da crisis of meaning 

writing is a way of avoiding action 
and keeping yourself in counterproductive loops without pushing u into action 
maybe i should move into solutions engineering

im bull that i need to do anything i can to work at the right company before its too late 
today i will send out apps to harvey + oai + anthropic

It's become abundantly clear that AGI is on the horizon within the next 5 years. There's a critical alignment problem to address to steer technology into the right direction - alignment between humans and technology, alignment between research and product. My current role scaling supercomputing at Microsoft has given me the privilege to partner closely with OAI's Fleet Hardware team, and build and deliver planned maintenance experiences that empower frontier model deployment. Working with OAI has given me insight to the incredible passion and determination the team is capable of - and while the ambitious challenges have inspired me to spearhead internal step-function changes within Microsoft's supercomputing-at-scale strategy, I believe I can achieve more direct impact moving one step closer to the model research teams. For this reason, I have high conviction in bringing my technical program management skills to OAI and optimize its internal processes so we can live up to the true potential of this technology.
