title: "on flow states"
---

solitude is how we reach out *flow states*, when we feel connected with ourselves and whatever creative outcome we are working towards

my flow states: 
* writing 
* taking photos (e.g botanic garden)
* yapping about a particularly engaging topic
* [[on running]] (especially to edm)
* listening to house music + working
anti flow states (prone to disruption)
* writing *emails* -- for some reason its so easy for me to get distracted from a simple sentence
* honestly doing a lot of work related tasks
* coding -- it's a very piecemeal process for me. i kinda stab at the problem and get overwhelmed by each draw back
* getting distracted by *yapping about nothing*
	* socialization is a big disruption to my flow state
