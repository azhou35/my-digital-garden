post race thoughts 
house parties are a thought experiment / artificial environment that we buy into and nothing we do is real 
how do we balance between vulnerability and charisma/mysteriousness when we interact with strangers? 
we all have experiences w ppl posturing
- eg crypto guy
- eg hrt guy
- eg oai has no moat guy
justin's "cheap tricks" to subvert the usual conversation flow:
* ask two people *you must be really good friends*
* how do you know the host? 
* what do you think of the party 
feels like the matrix
vulnerability vs perception 
- you want to present the view that you are a subject matter expert, but in personal relationships you want to show vulnerability
- eg justin/mahesh appreciate it when a girl talks about how they drank/blacked out cuz it shows they can have fun 
	- mahesh is worried anna is just too perfect and doesnt have this vulnerability
	- makes it harder o be vulneable yourself

matrix of opportunistic conversations:
* junior <> high level person 
* midlevel <> high level person
	* as midlevel you can pretend to be high level
i feel bad when a conversation goes well even though I KNOW it's not my fault
* it's bc the convo goes on autopilot and i so easily slip into canned responses i've practiced a millino times

conversations should be like improv, not acting
