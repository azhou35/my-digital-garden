Another important thread throughout the course examined the materiality of digital networks. In other words, systems that appear to exist in clouds and other immaterial spaces are always rooted in invisible yet very material infrastructures. For example, internet servers take up hundreds of squares of space and tasks like cleaning the internet of inappropriate content is typically accomplished not by algorithms but by workers in the Global South. We often discuss the sanitary or sustainable city, but how about the sanitary digital world? Is the invisibility of digital cleaners different from the invisibility of other types of maintainers? What is the emotional, physical and psychological toll that these workers experience? Turns out that clean streets as well as clean digital networks rely upon the invisible and displaced labor of marginalized peoples.

- mta:
	- authority is a ny state entity
	- owned by the City of New York with operating funds provided by the City of New York and subsidized by the state of New York
		- but it operates nyc, nys, and connecticut
		- comprrises: nyc transit, mta bus, metro north railroad
		- In a sample of 141 delayed electronic work orders (tickets), some took **up to 2 years** beyond established time frames to resolve.[](https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/state-agencies/audits/pdf/sga-2024-22s20.pdf)
		- In a 6-month sample, **31% of alarm events** were false alarms triggered by **employees not using access cards properly**.[](https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/state-agencies/audits/pdf/sga-2024-22s20.pdf)
-  the institutions and programs that would continue to care for and maintain these spaces and structures over time


inevitable limits of material resources of the planet will require more pliable, lightweight, and adaptive infrastructures for social, mobility, energy, water, food, and waste systems
