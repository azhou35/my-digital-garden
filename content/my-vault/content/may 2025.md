sf:
**perceived vastness**
i start the month 
earlier this year i came across the term "syncresis"[1](https://michaelnotebook.com/cosmos/index.html?curius=2215,1062,4233,4347,4287,3092,3085,3074,2825,2551,2055,1935,1592#fn1), in which two (or more) apparently opposed points of view are seen to really be instances of a single more powerful point of view. photography is a superpower to wield this phenomomen - by angling your camera, you control the framing of your surroundings, enveloping yourself within the situation at the same time as distancing youself from it. 
open yourself to wonder 
digital dopamine vs natutal wonder
actively seek experiences that are bigger than your ability to analyze them from a distance. 

*why our capacity for awe is humanity's most undervalued skill*

we live in a culture obsessed with personal branding & main character energy. yet, we are perhaps the only species that actively seeks the feeling of insignificance. 

a tree never contemplates its own majesty. an eagle doesn't pause mid-flight to marvel at the vastness below. 

but humans? we climb mountains just to feel dwarfed by them; we stare at stars as reminders of our own cosmic irrelevance. we seek experiences that make us feel beautifully, purposefully small.

this impulse has a name: the capacity for awe. and it's the answer to our epidemic of self-importance and our crisis for meaning.

it's chillier than i expected for a may afternoon. laying on a blanket that would be far better served preserving my body heat, we take in a postcard-perfect view of the painted ladies.
there's something voyeuristic about viewpoints—the nature exists at a safe distance, the buildings and ocean collaborating to create an idyllic frame for our consumption.

i raise my camera to capture the victorian houses: the viewfinder creating distance just as much as it demands presence. a way, i do what i always do: watching myself watch the view.

earlier this year i came across the term "syncresis"[1](https://michaelnotebook.com/cosmos/index.html?curius=2215,1062,4233,4347,4287,3092,3085,3074,2825,2551,2055,1935,1592#fn1), in which two (or more) apparently opposed points of view are seen to really be instances of a single more powerful point of view. photography is a superpower to wield this phenomomen - by angling your camera, you control the framing of your surroundings, enveloping yourself within the situation at the same time as distancing youself from it. 

nature is always in the purview here. but nature also serves to ground you. perhaps the biggest surprise to me as a forever east coaster is the sheer height of the californian reds. on a hike at land's end, i jerk my chin up at the trees that frame me, my neck nearly snapping like a stick. a mangled mixture descended in my throat that can only be described as fear and wonder. 

suddenly your self-importance shrinks. and you feel very small. 

it's an act of rebellion when you choose to feel small in the city built on the mythology of making it big. human agency 

full immersion demands your attention. we've trained ourselves to dopamine hits from social media - highlight reels of sunsets, mountain views, perfectly framed starscapes. 

there's something about being away from home that *increases your permeability to wonder.* it comes from seeing a new city, going to a concert, observing a natural park - any disruption to daily routine leaves you vulnerable to being overwhelmed. like a sponge you soak up this new experience, even if you can't quite understand the full picture of its majesty. 

awe invites a paradox. do you find this enlightening - a comforting feeling of interdependence - or terrifying - a dizzying reminder of insignificance?

we have no control over when awe strikes but we can choose how we respond. we can either become terrified or empowered, retreating deeper within ourselves or move towards deeper understanding. 

awe can manifest in several flavors: grand sweeping landscapes, powerful musical performances, even the everyday crowd of people. or it can be great scientific ideas, even religion.

when the mountains are in the distance, i retain my agency, framing the nature by which i see fit. but when i within the trees, the sheer magnitude of nature dwarfs my figure. 

rather than shy away from inexplicable beauty, seek out experiences that overwhelm us. that's how you expand your capacity for wonder. 

*awe is a lightning bolt that marks in memory those moments when the doors of perception are cleansed and we see with the startling clarity what is truly important life.*

the next weekend i flew to vegas for a music festival. vastness stretches her limbs outwards rather than upwards - etherized against the desert landscape and ripe for dissection. to get to the festival grounds entails a shuttle ride through the deserted air force complex - within the endless road of human ambition and artifice.

in a crowd of people you lose yourself, in every sense of the phrase. here you lose all sense of time, all sense of self. 

bass vibrates through your ribs and rattles in its new-found cage, transmitting movement to the rest of your body. pressed against the bodies of thousands, yet completely alone in the way that i perceive and react to the music. *my god my god whose performance am i watching? how many people am i? who am i? what is this space between myself and myself?  

at one point during the night we mount the bleachers on the side of the stage to rest and observe the entirety of the festival in its totality. from this vantage point see the full scale of the stage, what two hundred thousand attendees look like from afar. as blood-red fireworks pierce the twilight sky i fixate on the tiny specks of people in the crowd at the main stage. if i had zoomed out of myself during the set, is this how i look like? an mote of dust in the distance, one of many in an endless desert? 

you surrender yourself to the loss of control. 

when william shatner first went to space, he expected to understand the full harmony of the universe. instead, he felt its fullest isolation. 

the pale blue dot among other carl sagan books always fascinated me growing up. the syncresis of science: how a big bold universe is made up of tiny particles, how a scientist peers into a cell which makes up a whole living organism. based on what you're looking at you can use a telescope or a microscope. 

the tailsend of may was marked by a trip to my partner's hometown, where i met his parents for the first time. deeply spiritual, their parents took me to the temple, where i soaked in the practices of age-old traditions - walking around the figureheads, touching the figureheads, kneeling down and kissing the floor. in this moment i felt the syncresis - pointedly individual and distinct while inexplicibly part of something greater.

this was the final chapter of awe: an understanding that there is something greater than the material world. buddhism, catholocism, hinduism, are all conduits of awe and an acknowledgement that there are certain phenomoena that escape explanation. 


n expresses that he realizes how beautiful sf is, but also, this is not the type of beauty that strikes awe within. the sublime springs from . there is perhaps something just as man-made as the way sf takes the laws of nature and crushes them under its fists, crunching trees as of they were sticks 



? 



my week-long trip was punctured with mountains to climb. foolishly ignoring the meaning of why a neighborhood be called "nob *hill*," my stubby legs pumped up a 25% grade slope in pursuit of artisan coffee. ai billboards attached to (mountain name) like leeches.

it's always ironic to me, how apt sf is at living in the future while neglecting the present. it makes me question my own hedonic-first lifestyle - when i hike, should i fixate on the slope in front of me or the ground below my feet? 

to keep your eyes pointed towards the sky invites an inevitable love for the celestial. *syncresis of consciousness* refers to the juxtaposition of two remarkably different points of view - like an astronaut reflecting on the futility of human life looking downward from space.

to invite awe is to embrace these dual moments of syntcresis. 




what is it like to zoom out and look at yourself from third person? 


it's a simultaneously isolating and unifying experience. you realize you are one of many

it's a fair argument that without the cornerstone in our lives, we are all scraping for alternative frameworks of meaning. 

on the shuttle bus we transverse the vastness of life at extremes, an endless desert.


on the horizontal axis instead of vertical.
in sf i only see mountains to climb, mountains all the way down.
[[content/wisdom comes from wonder|wisdom comes from wonder]].

it makes me wonder - what inspires awe in you? 


is it being nature vs city?
in sf there are trees as tall as your eyes can imagine 
in nyc aluminum carves its name into the sky 
regardless the flavor, a feeling of awe seizes time by the throat 
time stands still - your self shrinks what is meaning and relevant 
- **Perceived Vastness** - Encountering anything larger than yourself (Grand Canyon, overview effect) that exceeds typical experiences; forces us to make sense of it and opens minds to change
- **The Small Self** - Feeling diminished relative to your environment; can be either enlightening (fostering humility and connectedness) or terrifying (if you're overly self-important)
- **Dual Nature of Awe** - Can be both wonderful and frightening; includes "threat-based forms of awe" when encountering something inconceivably powerful and mysterious
- **Response Choice** - When faced with awe, we can either become terrified or find empowerment in the experience
- **Transformation Process** - Moves from certainty toward deeper understanding, with awe serving as a catalyst for personal growth

humility, connectedness 
**the small self**
**vegas:**

what is it like to zoom out and look at yourself from third person? 
pressed against the bodies of thousands, yet completely alone in the way that i perceive and react to the music. *my god my god whose performance am i watching? how many people am i? who am i? what is this space between myself and myself?  


regardless the city you make bets on yourself. 

in vegas, vastness stretches her limbs on the horizontal access instead of vertical - 
concert vs isolation? 
the desert stretches her limbs
vegas is so articial i oftentimes forget it resides within the desert, a stark reminder provided by the tiny window in my hotel. 
people vs self? breaking the object self separation
in the casino there is no clock,

**chicago**:
circling around an indian temple with sanskrit falling to dead ears 
dosas served on plastic plates
in this neighborhood nearby delta flights departing from ohare command our attention
an airplane window frames our view o fhte wrld
  

i wanna speak about the contrast between self and crowd, loud and soft, nature and city, in a series of notes from three cities i travelled to in may.

life punctured by a mark
