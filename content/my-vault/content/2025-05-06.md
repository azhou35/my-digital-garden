im quite existential wah
i want to quit and join a startup so badly 

mai 3 model kick off is october 
own the nfz part for mai part tmrw 
walk them thru the nfz process

**reflection:**
im angsty right now because i want to leave microsoft
and seeing catherine leave microsoft and move to sf for a startup 
and hearing that ppl who were there for 3 years still havent gotten promoted to pm ii 
but i dont want to jump too early for a job like scale - it wil feel right if its in somewhere in ai infra 
new goal: want to leave by 1 1/2 years and make sure that im launching to the right startup that will propel my career 
its easy to have these goals but i wanna make sure i dont leave too early and i dont leave too late
by August 2025: find new job to jump into 

1.1k gpus 

things im disatsified with work right now: 
* not feeling like i am empowered to do work 
* feeling like a people coordinator more than a program manager 
* not launching any feature that actually are visible to the product 
* not talking to customers about their product needs
* feeling like movement is slow and that i am just managing and driving a program instead of thinking of a product pov 
* seeing the internal bloat at microsoft - how many ppl and owners u need to get thru to accomplish one task
* complete remote work making me feel disconnected from world
* 2 parts of job i dont really care about (fixing cyclecloud telemetry, running batch data)
* not working with an a star team

things im satisfied:
* highly flexible
* highly relevant and nascent technology - ai infra for supercomputing, for microsoft's most strategic bet 
* manager/teammates invested in career
