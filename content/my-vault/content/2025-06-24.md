Bg:
* TPM managing observability & planned maintenance for OpenAI's H100/H200 GPU clusters
* Built 0->1 copilots to help customers set up their batch schedulers 
* Background: PM roles at AI legal tech startup (Trusli, acquired by Gruve AI), AWS technical writing

**Why Greylock:
- Track record with category-defining enterprise companies
- Focus on technical founders solving hard problems
- Portfolio companies that need someone who can translate complex tech for customers
- Alignment with my experience in high-stakes, customer-facing technical roles

**What I'm Looking For:**
- Forward deployed engineering or technical PM roles
- Companies where I can bridge technical depth with customer-facing work
- Early-stage startups (Series A/B) where I can have significant impact
- Teams working on infrastructure, healthcare, or developer tools


**Passions**
**Inference Optimization:**
- **Baseten** - reducing time-to-serve, filling gaps traditional hyperscalers miss
- From my experience: training infrastructure is solved, inference optimization is the next frontier
- Horizontal platforms enabling faster AI deployment

**Observability & Infrastructure:**

- **Chronosphere** - making complex systems more transparent and manageable
- **Modular** - simplifying AI development workflows
- My sweet spot: turning complex technical systems into developer-friendly experiences

- **Notable** - streamlining clinical workflows, reducing administrative burden
- **Inflection AI** - conversational AI that could transform patient interactions
- Focus on operational efficiency vs. just diagnostic tools

- Discuss SAT13 
	- PHX12/62 IB + h100 hca 
	- CRD team would be available 
	- One thing to discuss is whether we want to time SAT13 before 61 or do 61 first
	- I believe before doing updates on on 61 we're waiting for HCA validation 
	- for SAT13 are we opinoinated on doing it before 61?

Working with financial services customers, I've seen their projects repeatedly stumble due to gaps in our AI infra services. Chalk's value prop directly aligns with my own mission to remove technical roadblocks and enable business-facing teams to move faster and more confidently.
My work talking directly with financial services customers on their AI infra has revealed massive gaps in how AI capabilities translate to practical business value. Chalk directly addresses some of the biggest issues I've seen come up - how to build enterprise-grade ML systems where observability is table-stakes. Its value prop directly aligns with my own mission to remove technical roadblocks and enable business-facing teams to move faster and more confidently. 

making me eager to explore NYC's unique concentration of AI infrastructure and vertical application companies. I'm particularly interested in the inference optimization space where startups like Baseten, Modal Labs, and Fireworks AI are solving the last-mile problem that hyperscalers struggle with—but I want to discover which NYC-based companies are building competitive solutions or identifying entirely new approaches to AI deployment at scale. The fellowship would give me access to evaluate emerging players in this space and understand how NYC's proximity to enterprise customers creates different opportunities than Silicon Valley's consumer-focused ecosystem.
