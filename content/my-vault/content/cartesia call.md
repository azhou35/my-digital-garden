writing community:
substack users
writing process

**the pitch:**
- would love to chat more on how to access the writing community, share feedback, swap notes, even go to events on behalf of you
- happy to lend my knowledge and passion for writing and evangelize fellow writers into trying out the product, providing feedback 
- my personal goal is to build and connect the substack writing community 
- still super involved with startups as part of my work, writing for contrary, connecting w new york startup ecosystem
	- would love to chat on what ur doing at cartesia
- interested in writing a series exploring the intersection of human connection and the technology that powers it, would love to pilot that with cartesia
- - excited about what you're building here, would love to stay connected and explore ways we can work together more deeplyas cartesia grows 
- ai-enabled creativity alisng with my own interests, would be keen to stay in touch and contribute more substantially as u expand the team

voice use cases:
* increase # of subscribers listening to my emails
	* healthy open rate, but low engagement 
	* no numbers for this but i doubt everyone is reading it thru
	* i send it during commute/lunch, very short amount of time to engage a reader 
	* tiktok philosophy is to engage a user within 15 seconds of opening - need a way to replicate this on substack
	* id imagine it be similar to opening a voice memo from justin vs 5 texts in a row
* Targeted distribution for 1:1 coach calls (ava, kasra,
* An experience to read ur top 5 substack articles in voice (like Spotify DJ)
* Even an experience for the notes we read 
* writing process
	* AI voice helping us get feedback
* definitely power in multimodal expression
* real time translation 

Listeners are increasingly focused on niche content and AI-powered tools are being used to enhance podcast production, distribution, and monetization. These tools include AI algorithms that enable podcasters to automate tasks such as audio editing and transcription. Podcasts are also creating more cohesive storytelling experiences by collaborating with other media platforms like books, TV shows, and movies. Furthermore, many podcasts are now being filmed and shared as video content on platforms like YouTube, expanding their reach and potential audience.
on substack:
* "you know what ai has not given us? more seconds to be alive"
* substack uses a lot of ai
	* decagon
	* poly markets
* embrace audio/video

questions on cartesia:
* as someone empowering foundational models (indirectly) ive always been interested in the product philosophy when it comes to these huge models we train - typical product thinking is find a user problem and build a tech around that, but with the power of models we see the model's capabilities and see what use cases exist. how do you balance both and advocate for this and when does a lab turn from research to product?
* what is the big picture for voice agents for writers? do you have aspirations to integrate with substack directly? what kind of writer do you want to filter for? 
* - What types of writers are their early adopters?
	* scale of newsletter vs importance of voice vs 
- How are they thinking about integration with platforms like Substack?
- What specific pain points in the writing-to-audio conversion process are they targeting?
- how do you see this product evolving beyond initial audio features? going from a nice to have to a must 
- What messsaging are you thinking for this product?
