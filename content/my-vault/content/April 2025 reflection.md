ironically, after resolving to prioritize health & fitness in my march reflection, my body completely broke down (from a common cold, of all things!) the first half of april. during this infected limbo i learned an obvious lesson: if mental clarity isn't there, it's impossible for me to do anything, whether its rote tasks at work.

social-wise, i minimized inbound and only accepted outbound. this meant fewer post-work hangs (which definitely triggered a feeling of disconnectedness). 

music played a big role this month - went to bahar's jazz night hosted out of her apartment, watched whiplash and got some second-hand anxiety from my brief band days.

career as a catayst.
my thinking is that there are two paths for my next job: 1) strategy/ops/customer success role at an early startup aligned with ai infra/observability/general data engineering, 2) tpm role at a series d+ startup. or 3) stay where you are at microsoft, try to get promoted by year 2.5, see where the exit opportunities are there. i noodled into the idea of product studios, and generally became amenable to the idea of prototyping. 

the question is - how much do i want to leave?
some wins: a cold email to fal.ai converted to a call, got some inbound from scale, got through some rounds at ramp. many L's: i'd need to move to sf and my jump after one year is a red flag, scale billed itself with 80+ hr work weeks, i got rejected after a business case i had assumed i crushed. this month i got some real feedback based on the feelers that i've been putting up, and the process rlly does feel like putting a square inside of a circular hole: when will i find my cubical match? learnings: i need to practice presenting. 
meeting up with other microsoft pms at a recruiting event validated that some of my anxiety over wanting to leave is seeing others leave - for some reason i want to do things before other people leave. 

a key insight: when the cost of creation becomes zero, it becomes especially essential to identify where you direct your attention and care.

authenticity as a core value. 

another key insight: everything about your life is just made up by the way you frame it. 

i discovered enneagrams and a new frame to narrate my mythology. a 4w3 - individualist and achievement-whore - i ask claude what my greatest weakness is and it's within my tendency to think more than i act, to philosophize longer than i build. therein lies a deep tension as i battle for harmony
inner world vs outer world.
