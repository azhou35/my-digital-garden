*Why do I write?*
Because I feel [[How to Write|emotions]] that are too overwhelming to simply speak out loud. Because I get stuck in loops of overthinking, hamster-wheel-cognition trapping me into helplessness lest I release its momentum elsewhere. Because there are so many [[nameless feeling]]s in the world that I want to approximate. Because there's a synergy when two unrelated words come together and form a metaphor that's deeper than the two words apart. 

I write to claw myself out of funks when remote work makes me feel disconnected and untethered from the physical word. I write to reflect after a rapid series of *living life* makes me numb to actually *experiencing* it.

A fellow photographer friend shared Sean Tucker's theory of street photography with me - how a compelling image builds itself in layers, each one adding depth to the final composition:

**Layer One: Aesthetics**
The foundation: framing, color, light and shadow. Most photos begin and end here, in rule-of-thirds compositions and sunset silhouettes.

**Layer Two: Subject & Story**  
Beyond aesthetics lies narrative. The image stops showing and starts asking: Who? Why? What brought us to this moment?

**Layer Three: Motion & Action**
Not just freezing time, but suggesting its flow - a gesture mid-completion, a step about to land, the weight of what's about to happen.

**Layer Four: Alchemy**
The ephemeral ingredient that transforms technique into magic - that perfect accident, that unexpected juxtaposition that turns the mundane into gold.

In photography, resonance happens when all four layers - aesthetics, story, motion, and alchemy - align to create something so powerful it vibrates. It's less about mastering technique or following rules. Its striking the perfect note, creating an image that touches something universal through something deeply specific to resonate with the viewer.

>  Louise Gluck: “Those of us who write books presumably wish to reach many. But some poets do not see reaching many in spatial terms, as in the filled auditorium. They see reaching many temporally, sequentially, many over time, into the future, but in some profound way these readers always come singly, one by one.”

I used to think resonance in art meant reaching the widest possible audience. But as Louise Glück suggests, perhaps true resonance isn't about filling an auditorium - it's about creating work that reverberates through time, finding its receivers one by one, each connection pure and individual.

 This is why I create: to send these vibrations out into the world, hoping they find the hearts tuned to receive them. Each photograph, each piece of writing, becomes a frequency searching for its resonant chamber.
