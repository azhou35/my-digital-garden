Repetition is at the core of religion, which is what it can feel like at times — to feel the pleasure of some grand, important thing, to glimpse a panoramic view, inhaling, passerby dissolving into dirt, fluid and advancing as intended, yes, as I was made to do, on and on and on, until forever ends, beneath the shade of a eucalyptus tree (a delicious smell), where I return to myself.

That’s really the best way I can put it. These days I find I’m often chasing presence, and there is no type of presence more arresting than one you are forced into out of exertion. A total, lingering awareness of being alive, and empty, all at once.


Schools and schooling; education and AI; media and publishing; the Silicon Valley canon (the DC canon?); intelligence; and, especially, book reviews — new, old, forgotten, under-appreciated, the book of your life
