title: "entropy - intro v2"
---

Last month, four of my five flights were delayed. A one hour hop turned into four hours at the gate, not because anything
dramatic happened, but because the flight before mine was late, and the one before that, and the one before that. The delay
felt personal. It was not. It was a system showing its seams.

Modern life is full of small frictions that look like bad luck: the train that crawls, the bridge that needs “urgent
repairs,” the grocery aisle that keeps missing one item, the app that “temporarily” cannot load. We talk about these as
isolated annoyances. More often, they are signals. The systems underneath us are strained, and we have trained ourselves not
to see them until they fail.

We perceive our systems as broken. In reality, we have made them invisible and modeled them incorrectly. 

Infrastructure powers our world - the public transit that gets us to work, the energy that powers our homes. These systems self-organize and control processes in a self-regulating loop. It's an unsexy industry - when we look at a building, we first admire the craft of the architecture and design, and rarely consider the supply chain logistics and utility grids that birthed it to being. It's a feature not a bug: our power lines and transportation systems are designed to be unnoticed. 

Software has softened us with a friction-less life. Instant response. Infinite retries. We then project those expectations onto our daily lives - expecting instant trains and constantly operational busses. But these systems operate under real-world constraints.

The gap is widened as we optimized systems for efficiency. In construction projects we cut corners and squeeze out costs, chosen optimization over resilience. As a result, systems become tightly coupled and have no room to fail. But efficiency cannot eliminate risk - it simply pushes it downstream.

We call this entropy: systems drift toward disorder unless energy, attention, and feedback are applied on purpose. There are two headwinds here: life is getting more chaotic at the same time our systems are becoming more tightly coupled. Our worsening climate situation means more hurricanes/earthquakes/storms to strain our systems, and globalization and progress has made intrasystem interdependence such that when when one failure point fails, the effects travel fast. A disruption in one place now ripples across industries elsewhere.

*entropy* is a newsletter about making those hidden systems legible. It exists as a place to look closely at the networks and infrastructure that govern everyday life, and at how years of overuse and strain have pushed them toward their limits. In the present, that means understanding how systems came to be and how they function today. In the past, it means examining how systems like factories or infrastructures failed, the signals we missed, and the writing on the wall. 

My stake is simple. I live inside these systems. I plan my life around
I plan my life around public transit and airport schedules, and I work in a world where abstraction makes constraints easy to forget. I am writing this to build a better model of what is failing, what is merely strained, and what it would take to make our systems resilient again.

In the past, it means examining how systems like factories or infrastructures failed, the signals we missed, and the writing on the wall. 

Collapse may look sudden, but the damage has been accumulating quietly for years.

The future means grappling with *what comes next*. As *Gradient Journal* puts it, "within our lifetime we will have to figure out how to rethink the way American settlements are made and how they operate. We have to rethink how we get our water, how we get our power, and how we store and transmit it. We have to rethink how we move, how we eat, how we govern ourselves. ***All of this is necessary because it’s clear that the design standards of the infrastructure we have did not contemplate the climate we are now living within***. Much of our current infrastructure is too fragile or brittle to survive."

Infrastructure is not only technical - it's social and institutional.It is infrastructure is built for our communities and should mirror the social structure it servers. We share water with our neighbors. We rely on our local hospitals for vaccines and care. When infra and communities drift in different directions, we need ongoing recalibration to keep incentives, policy, and construction pointed in the same direction.



And this is why it feels like our world is falling apart: the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is crumbling beneath our feet; [flight delays cascade thanks to outdated air control systems](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5424682/air-traffic-control-overhaul). The truth is that our bridges and airports are beyond their expected life span, and yet we cannot sustain the impact of taking these out of our system.

growing up i was fixated by *the butterfly theory* - that the flap of a wing in X can impact weather in Y. life is all about the ripple effects of a single action and the messy problems and unfinished answers that emerge.  

I measure out my life with public transit options - day trips to New York marked by long 
why me? im a public transit nerd beholden to the whims of the mta. grew up with parents who were public transit nerds - being from a town where everyone's parents commuted into the city, we were abundantly aware of the quirks of the nj transit. (so much so, that my mom had a brief stint there as a software engineer). we spent weekends taking the path train into world trade center, back when it wasn't a beautifully ornate marble structure but just a box under construction. moreover: i'm motivated by systems-level thinking, choice theory, as well as the way it shapes our behaviors. 

I want to study the systems, infrastructures, and networks that make up our world. 

This essay marks the beginning of a new strand of this newsletter, which I’m calling *entropy*. It exists as a place to look closely at the systems that govern everyday life, and at how years of overuse and strain have pushed them toward their limits.

In the present, that means understanding how systems came to be and how they function today -- why is the NYC metro constantly late?
