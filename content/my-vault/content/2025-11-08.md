i feel a bit lonely these days
my boyfriend is so far from me
i know i like this job but i dont 

the fog sits on the town like a steady presence 
the chinatown is on a hill

and i can see the city tumble up and down 
i have no love to write for this place yet

what is this prevailing feeling of loneliness that ifeel?

i am experiencing writers block and i dont know what to write about

i almost miss having meetings or work bc then i would have something to do 


sitting in boredom is very hard

i am sitting in a room of all red hugging a pillow that is red.

fall is my favorite season & i hate to missit. 

the days dribble into the next. a swath of mist as fog 

chinahas manifest destiny which is why it seize the way the way it does 

is san francisco really my city??

some people love it here
i will always compare it to new york 
the growing pains ofanew city
