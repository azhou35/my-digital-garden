# Case Study Response Framework

## 1. Problem Understanding (1-2 minutes)

"Thank you for this case study. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly:

- We're facing an issue with [restate the key challenge]
- The main stakeholders are [finance teams/employees/etc.]
- The goal is to [improve adoption/reduce friction/save time/save money]

Before I dive in, are there any specific constraints or additional context I should be aware of?"

## 2. Analysis Approach (2-3 minutes)

"To understand this situation fully, I would approach the analysis in three parts:

**Data Analysis:**

- First, I'd query our database to understand [relevant metrics] using SQL
- For example, I might write a query like:
    
    ```
    SELECT customer_segment, COUNT(distinct customer_id), 
    AVG(adoption_rate)
    FROM customers
    GROUP BY customer_segment
    ORDER BY AVG(adoption_rate) ASC
    ```
    
- This would help us identify [specific insight]

**Qualitative Research:**

- I'd partner with our customer-facing teams to gather feedback through:
    - Targeted customer interviews focusing on [specific questions]
    - Support ticket analysis to identify common pain points
    - Usage analytics to see where users might be dropping off

**Cross-functional Input:**

- I'd coordinate with Product Managers to understand the product vision
- Engage with Engineering to understand technical constraints
- Consult with Finance to understand business priorities"

## 3. Solution Framework (3-4 minutes)

"Based on this analysis, I'd develop a solution framework with three core components:

**Short-term Improvements:**

- Quick wins we could implement in 2-4 weeks, such as:
    - [Specific improvement 1]
    - [Specific improvement 2]
    - Process documentation to address immediate gaps

**Medium-term Enhancements:**

- Features or process improvements for the next quarter:
    - [Enhancement 1] focused on [specific problem]
    - [Enhancement 2] to increase adoption/efficiency

**Long-term Vision:**

- Strategic initiatives that might take 6+ months:
    - [Strategic initiative] that aligns with Ramp's mission of saving time and money
    - [Integration or automation opportunity]"

## 4. Implementation Plan (2-3 minutes)

"For implementation, I'd recommend a phased approach:

**Phase 1: Alpha Testing (2 weeks)**

- Internal testing with Ramp employees
- Build measurement framework with key metrics including:
    - [Metric 1] to track [outcome 1]
    - [Metric 2] to assess [outcome 2]

**Phase 2: Beta with Select Customers (4 weeks)**

- Select 5-10 customers from different segments
- Create enablement documentation and training
- Collect structured feedback through surveys and interviews

**Phase 3: General Availability (2 weeks post-beta)**

- Coordinate with Marketing on messaging
- Prepare customer success teams with training materials
- Set up automated monitoring for key metrics"

## 5. Success Measurement (1-2 minutes)

"To measure success, I'd track:

**Core Metrics:**

- Time saved: [specific measure]
- Money saved: [specific measure]
- Adoption rate: [specific measure]

**User Satisfaction:**

- NPS for the feature
- Support ticket volume related to this area

**Business Impact:**

- Revenue impact or cost savings
- Competitive differentiation"

## 6. Close (1 minute)

"In summary, my approach focuses on:

1. Understanding the problem through data and customer insights
2. Developing targeted solutions aligned with Ramp's mission
3. Implementing with a structured process from alpha to general availability
4. Measuring success through quantifiable metrics
