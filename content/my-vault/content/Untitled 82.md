What second-order effects should we anticipate if we solve this? (e.g., if we speed up maintenance, does that create new bottlenecks in job scheduling?) What risks do we incur by not solving this now? (urgency vs. deferral) How does this fit into the broader infra/AI roadmap? Systems & Scale Thinking What happens at 10× scale — would the same approach still hold? Where are the current single points of failure, both technical and organizational? If we had to design this to fail gracefully, what would that look like? Tradeoffs & Prioritization What’s the hardest tradeoff here — reliability vs. speed, efficiency vs. flexibility? If we had to choose between short-term operational fixes and long-term platform investments, where would we lean? Where do we risk over-optimizing — what’s “good enough” vs. what must be perfect? Organizational & Cross-Functional Lens Which teams would need to align for this to succeed, and where are the likely friction points? What does escalation look like when vendor or infra partners (e.g., Microsoft, NVIDIA) don’t meet commitments? How do we make this program visible so downstream teams can trust it? Measurement & Durability What metrics would leadership use to judge if this is truly successful? What failure modes do we expect — and how will we know early if the solution isn’t working?
