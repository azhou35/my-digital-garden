and the movement from universities/government to cloud 

a *supercomputer* is defined as a computer that is unmatched by speed. 
it was birthed by seymour cray, who created the first supercomputer in 1964 and continued to dominate through the 70s and 80s. 
like many innovations during the late 1900s, supercomputing was fueled by a desire to win wars. during the cold war, the u.s. department of energy poured investments into nuclear simulations to crunch numbers to unbreakable speeds. the first computer cdc 6600 was built during the arms race of numbers.

supercomputing found it's second home in academia up to the 2000s. useful for weather modeling, fluid dynamics, and chemistry, researchers used these parallel computers as part of university labs. 

currently we live in the age of the supercomputer on cloud. hyperscalers realized that their top customers had workloads that matched those of scientists: petabytes of data, dense computation, highthroughput. 

today the largest supercomputers fund ai computing.
