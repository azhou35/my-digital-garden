wordvec was a beast 
numerical representation of every word and you can do maths
how do you stuff a formal language and integrate it with natural language
it's time to get rid of this classification paradigm - doesnt scale
[[fuzzy vs unfuzzy systems]]
[[fuzzy choice theory]]
requires reasoning? 
- starts with basic cosine similarity 
"prompt and pray"
prompt to get things to return to json - you have to guide it to the right formal program
how do you build a system that marries two worlds?
-> conversational ai 

translate user input into encoded variables that show "this is how user is communicating"
-> deterministic questions
task logic is deterministic
you only pause to ask users for input 
in vogue idea that LLM should be dynamic and reasoning
-> i think hes multistep > reasoning
business logic is reliable and deterministic -> this is why fsi likes tihs
COM - informational insight
book a ticket:
* reserve seat, get info, multiple stops where things can fail, HARD to do for llm
pull out:
what is important for evauating llm system?
* reliability
* accuracy 
* performance
* detail
