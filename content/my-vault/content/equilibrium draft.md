*reflecting on 2024 via physics lessons*

sarah kay once said something along the lines of - every time i am writing i wish i was out living. every time i am living i wish i was in writing. my initial takeaway was that living a full life was at odds with writing an interior life. writing was reserved for pandemic phases and holiday months, while living swallowed up the other spaces of the calendar. 

to my surprise, the year that i've lived the most fully is also the year i've written the most.  i now understand - i need to live a life worth writing about, and write in a way that makes life worth living. there's a synergy to cultivate between consumption and creation, and with each year i'm approximating an equilibrium. 

perhaps that's what equilibrium really means - not a static state of perfect balance, but a dynamic dance between opposing forces. between writing and living. between solitude and connection. between the gravitational pull of routine and the escape velocity of dreams. (between the safety of orbit and the allure of undiscovered stars??) the tension this balancing act strikes is uncomfortable - it would be easier to to submit myself to solitude and prioritize creation above all else, tempting to lose myself completely in the chaos of constant motion. 

the richest life exists not at the poles, but in the messy middle where opposing forces meet - where the push and pull creates its own kind of stability. in 2024 i learned balance doesn't come from staying still - it comes from the rhythm of constant flux, dynamic stability as opposed to static balance.

all my life i've felt trapped in a frame, and this is the first year i've stepped out of it. but freedom from constraints brings its own vertigo - without walls, reality stretches into white emptiness. and so i learned to build my own anchors: self-truths and theories about the world to act as my compass. from the lens of these schema, these are the patterns i've traced to make sense of the past year.

**the gravitational field of friendship**
(n): the invisible force created by overlapping bonds of shared interests, mutual connections, and accumulated experiences that holds people in orbit around each other. 
*related notes: [[a real third place is a bookstore]]*
I spent the first few months floating in LA, Shanghai, SF: temporary cities that never felt like home.  *feeling like an astronaut jettisoned into space,* I noted in a journal entry. Sartre taught me *anxiety is the dizziness of freedom* and I'd jolt from sleep with bouts of vertigo - phantom falls in mystic mid-air. 2023 was marked by environment changes in quick succession, where I would make a lot of friends at once, and our bonds would dissipitate once we parted ways. I learned a new meaning to solitude and yearned for companionship.

This led me to think about what I'll call relational gravity: the invisible force that holds social groups together. Like planets need a star to orbit around, communities need a center of mass - something stronger than just the initial attraction that brings people together.

In anticipation of my move to NYC, I worried about this gravity. I was arriving at an unconventional time - mid winter, when most of my peers had yet to enter and my older friends had already established their own orbital systems. My past felt like a series of temporary solar systems: college, internships, study abroad. Summer camp on repeat, each one collapsing once its season ended.

In order to hold any social group together - friend group, community, club - you need a dense center of gravity.

February 24. First day in the city, floating in space. A month to go before work started. I kicked off my search for "third places" - social spaces separate from home and office that could act as gravitational centers. I went to coworking events, bookstores, cafes. I sent many first and second texts, way fewer third. The strength and weakness of New York lies in its transience - it is so easy to enter the orbit of strangers, and so easy to drift away.

What keeps us together when the universe is ever-expanding, driving distance between me and you? In June, doodling network diagrams on paper, I arrived at a theory of relational density: bonds strengthen when they're reinforced by multiple points of connection. Whether it's mutual friends or shared interests, these overlapping ties create a stronger gravitational field. Like dark matter, invisible but essential, these connections define the shape of our social universe.

Seeing my relationships through their density shifted my mindset. I sought these points of connection - wanting to know my friends' friends, to understand their passions, to find the overlapping circles in our Venn diagrams of interests. There's value in investing in your relationships. 

Next year is all about increasing this density - creating more points of connection, strengthening the gravitational fields that keep us in each other's orbits.

##### creative inertia 
(n): the tendency for artistic momentum to stay in motion, transferring from person to person, medium to medium
[[creative intertia]]
The biggest driver of my writing habit isn't discipline or deadlines - it's the creative current underpinning my friendships. I discuss themes of power and aesthetics with my friend ruminating on her next oil painting. In a crammed smoothie shop I chat with Bahar on song-writing and production. [enter my more detail]. This very yearly reflection is inspired by Justin's writing rituals. 

Creativity follows its own laws of thermodynamics: it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. When I see a painting in a museum, it converts to words in my journal. When I finish writing a piece, it metamorphoses into an urge to take photos. When I watch a friend's short film, it crystallizes into a new creative experiment of my own. The medium changes, but the momentum persists. [ rewrite]

I used to worry about being a jack of all trades - photographer, doodler, writer, poet, curator - master of none. But I've come to see these different mediums as prisms, each one refracting the same light from a different angle. Universal questions about love, growing up, nostalgia, guilt - they travel through each medium, picking up new frequencies, revealing different shades of truth.

This year, I've learned to cultivate this creative inertia intentionally. Writing clubs became weekly constants. Photo walks with friends turned into regular rituals. Each creative conversation, each shared project, each collaborative moment added to our collective momentum. Because creativity, like any force, amplifies when it resonates between people - turning potential energy into kinetic creation, transforming private inspiration into shared motion. The question isn't whether something is "art" or "content" - it's whether it maintains this momentum, whether it carries enough charge to spark creation in others. 

Ultimately, creative inertia isn't just about keeping your own practice in motion. It's about being part of a larger system of exchange, an ecosystem of inspiration and expression, where every piece of art is both an outcome and a beginning. There's nothing more inspiring than seeing the work of my own creative friends: their momentum drives me to create.

my writing process depends on constant inspiration. the urge to write sparks from seeing a work of art that makes me think. 
- writing clubs 
- conversations with friends who are song-writers, videographers, visual artists
- at its heart storytelling 
- Creativity is a force of energy which means it never dies: it gets transferred from person to person
potential energy --> kinetic energy
art is a vessel of so much potential -- 
* how do you determine "art" vs "content"?
  * from photographer, doodler, writer, poet, curator — I’m a jack of all trades, master of none, & maybe that’s ok. Different mediums help me explore the same concept from different angles—universal truths on love, growing up, nostalgia, guilt, all dissected in some way. I see each different creative pursuit as different steps in a creative workflow where the end goal is to ponder some question: 
  *   * even if not in the same discipline. I get so excited on calls with my friend from college, as we share whatever creative side quests we’ve embarked on. I text my friend about new photo series ideas and we send each other the pictures that hit hard. * 
* data points: # of photo walks, writing clubs, events held 

**escape velocity**
I jotted down many side projects and events in 2024. And many never came to life. What’s holding back some of my dreams? Is it time, energy, perfectionism, or fear? 
* I write with enough momentum for my anxieties/insecurities/feelings to reach escape velocity and escape the prison of my own making. 
* A big change from 2023 is how many people I talked to about my ideas in 2024. 
* There's still a lot of ideas for side projects that have yet to reach escape velocity: they're stuck in my head, in my notes app, in promises given to friends. 
* writing / running t oachieve escape velocity 
##### Visual & Optical Resonance
(n) the phenomenon where art achieves frequency with meaning - when technique and emotion synchronize to create vibrations that others can feel. like sound waves reaching their resonant frequency, it occurs when form and meaning amplify each other until they become inseparable.
[[Purple Prose]]
*Why do I create? Why write? Why take pictures?* 
These questions chase me through every creative pursuit. *What makes something good? Who am I making it for?

I drive myself mad with this question. Unconcerted creative spurts lead to nowhere. I read *ambition without direction is just anxiety* and so I sit, racking my brains for an answer. 

A fellow photographer friend shared Sean Tucker's theory of street photography with me - how a compelling image builds itself in layers, each one adding depth to the final composition:

**Layer One: Aesthetics**
The foundation: framing, color, light and shadow. Most photos begin and end here, in rule-of-thirds compositions and sunset silhouettes.

**Layer Two: Subject & Story**  
Beyond aesthetics lies narrative. The image stops showing and starts asking: Who? Why? What brought us to this moment?

**Layer Three: Motion & Action**
Not just freezing time, but suggesting its flow - a gesture mid-completion, a step about to land, the weight of what's about to happen.

**Layer Four: Alchemy**
The ephemeral ingredient that transforms technique into magic - that perfect accident, that unexpected juxtaposition that turns the mundane into gold.

In photography, resonance happens when all four layers - aesthetics, story, motion, and alchemy - align to create something so powerful it vibrates. It's less about mastering technique or following rules. Its about creating images that resonate with the viewer's own lived experience and touch something universal through something deeply specific.

* resonance as a transfer of energy 
	* it's the energy of words aligning w meaning
	* photography - energy of light and composition aligning with emotion 
	* when creators achieve resonance, their work vibrates at a frequency that others can feel - an amplification of their vision that ripples outward
>  Louise Gluck: “Those of us who write books presumably wish to reach many. But some poets do not see reaching many in spatial terms, as in the filled auditorium. They see reaching many temporally, sequentially, many over time, into the future, but in some profound way these readers always come singly, one by one.”

I used to think resonance in art meant reaching the widest possible audience. But as Louise Glück suggests  perhaps true resonance isn't about filling an auditorium - it's about creating work that reverberates through time, finding its receivers one by one, each connection pure and individual.


In writing, it's when words and meaning achieve such perfect alignment that they create sympathetic vibrations in the reader. 

Like a tuning fork striking its perfect note, the work hums with an energy that transfers from creator to viewer, from present to future, carrying meaning across the space between us. This is why I create: not to reach the most people at once, but to send these vibrations out into the world, hoping they find the hearts tuned to receive them. Each photograph, each piece of writing, becomes a frequency searching for its resonant chamber.

#### Intentionality is Everything
2024 was a lot of "drinking from the firehose," to quote the phrase I repeated endlessly to my manager during onboarding. 
I embraced my multiple interests and hobbies and my friends from all over. 

New Year's resolutions imply a fixed goal, a rigid plan to success. 

Resolution stems from the Latin word *resolvere*, which means "to loosen or let go." Sometimes I desire outcomes so whole-heartedly it hurts. I see a dream life and hold it so tightly it cuts to my fingers and I bleed. 

My first year in the city was infused w a latent restlessness, an ennui, plagued by a paralysis that from here, *where do I go?* 

I want to resolve in the literal sense: loosen tension, clarify my energy, and live with intention rather than obligation. *Ambition without direction* is just anxiety, and 2025 is all about finding the right direction to direct this energy so it doesn't spill out from within me. 

in 2025 i want to live a life so full it bursts at the seams, sticky-persimmon sweetness oozing past skin. a life so ordinary yet beautiful it begets not biography but memoir. i struggle to describe my substack but perhaps this is it: an aspirational memoir.

#### A Final Note on Memory

"Thus are our memories compressed, integrated into sparkling jewels to be embedded in the limited space of our minds. A scene is turned into a mnemonic, a conversation reduced to a single phrase, a day distilled to a fleeting feeling of joy. 
Time's arrow is the loss of fidelity in compression. A sketch, not a photography. A memory is a re-creation, precious because it is both more and less than the original."

If I picture myself years down the line thinking about 2024, it's unlikely I'll be pressed on the intellectual theories I struggle to form, or the gigabytes of videos burning a hole in my memory drive, or the endless thoughts I had on runs that I failed to capture in writing.
