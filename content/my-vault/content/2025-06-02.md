meeting w joe chau 
june will be eventful for inglewood gb200
- big training run on july 27
trying to squeeze as much as possible:
key thing to do:
upgrade for 1.1 across entire fleet
get this cluster to a state to start the sla 
move this program from execution to operations
joes team: responsible for buildout
prabhat wants to work on ops

bijesh:
- important for microsoft to start charging
- oai call out dc power measurement is a requirement b4 production 
- lets have one meeting tg 
- how confident that power measurement will be matched
- older iw we dont deploy beyond 4.1 megawatts
- any higher it can exhaust and drain ups 
- firrst time deploing 9.4 
- 10 pf
- collect data to decide what level we operate at
- running this massive load simultaneously
- air cooled dc -> liquid cooled dc 
- no news is bad news 
- share plan w aditya and annie 
bijesh: 
- oai wants to know end to end plan for 1.1 update plan 
	- include update and bijesh 
	- thursday call 
- clear equivalence class 
- but datacenters being diff should be good
not impactful
polaris pulse - scaling up scaling down
trying to replicate traiing guide
oai will run this 
tool has been modified for gb200s
look out for cc 

there is the mtf configuration which is not needed in phx62
wants to make sure scaling tests work 
many thing going on 

power testing standpoint - 
would power testing would ned to be before or after
oai will need access to cluster

needs to be either before or after 1.1
62 - takes 1 day
12 - takes 1 week
1.1 update cleans out vms
we redeploy the vms post update

in term of power usage ![[Pasted image 20250602165225.png]]dont wanna compound tehe risk
maybe we get power out first
phx12 first ideal
phx12/62 power testing coordination 
use this opportune time to do shakeout - whatever tests w ewanna do such that when we return we feel comfortable we can start billing them and meeting our sla commitments

damian -
and nvlink 
john briggs responsible for operations for nvlink 

john briggs + chahandras + damian 

after this is all done, ask oai to get billing 

starting big job on july 7 
have to get accepted before june 
2 weeks - poer stuff takes at least 1 week
1.1 takes half of delay

figure out the plans john bijsh and john can help commit

capacity - u need to give joe a heads up on how man nodes you need to push 

conssitent cofnfiguraation - boris has a fingerprint configuration 
bijesh - tests have to be passed
meeting w aditya going 
pre-test run check in 
during test have live call 
oai going to phx12 and 62

exit criteria: make sure microsoft write paper 
or do we need to produce powepoint slide
wanted all the raw data

plan we present preliminary timeline on thurs
figure out a tiemline by thurs 
1.1 + power stuff 
latest by early week to do week
week of 9th and 16th 
hopefully we can get started 
sannity check across our team
ib team/nvlink
last chance to do any testing 

joe has meeting to have 1PM meeting to drive alignment 
need 1 answer

1.1 - joes worried - lots of fallover need to recover 
running power test first

power test dont need ib and everthing 

this is an end game 
rn - lets using 1.0 call - get the king lease 
OAI what needs to be done 

have a list of wahat needs to be done 
1.0 - get 5-10 minutes 
walk thru the list 
- callon 
- nvlink

take the status 
after that follow up 
wanna give raghu and nidhi a status
color code - green yello red

what are the open issues with execution 
who are the right ppl
- telephone book 
	- prabhat decision 
joe is woried
fairwater is going on 
mai going on 
gb300 going on in august 
ask any partner team to dedicate resource
want prabhat team to take over inglewood

pm is moving over to team
pm side has someone dedicated
working on same schedule as one team

worried about things we dont nkow
gain confidence about the power test
help bijesh to look into that
run something on phx trial first
phx 62 is just execution

all the way to ganesh to support
figure out waht do we need
work w prabhat to finalize plan
bc its related to sla enablement 
inglewood sla is just about nodes in service

when should we start billing/start?
