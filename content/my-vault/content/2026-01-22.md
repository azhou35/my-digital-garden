top of mind
- getting to something sustainable for ops
	- turn up / turnups  ops
	- expecting 3x gpus by end of year
	- +300k gpus by end of quarter
- sreekanth - 
	- clear set of requirements from requirements 
V-1
- define what we want 
V0 
- get the stuff we want
V1 
- get the stuff we want in medium control


System called temporal 
- moreso a workflow executor 
	- for cluster turnup 
- orchestrate the steps

kick off these workflows

sla misses
- kick off a workflow
- lets analyze whats going wrong
- throw all the data 
- have it come up w an assessment
- present to some set of humans

### Ops Call
- turn on-call -> ops 
- make it a stand up thing for ops 
	- 1 min around the desk to say this is what are the things that on call is on 
- annie is nominated for lead 
- will on-call 
	- >week 
- there is a spreadsheet that someone eis maintained 
- argon side 
- spud is supposed to start feb 1 
- argon 
	- NIS story 
	- do we have major problems here
	- NVL remains biggest category
- nodes that are stuck in intake
**argon** 
- doesnt have the classes of errors that we neede to see 
	- argon defining operational process w OCI 
	- they can figure out which racks which nodes to prioritize
		- make sure oci prioritizes towards vd64 
	- argon inventory sync 
- recovery time post-repave
	- goal is 45 min post-repve
	- biggest issue is fw update
		- applying MRC updates can take 45 min 
		- what time is actually spent on reboots
- cluster turnups - saagar wants to build automation here 
	- what have we dropped the ball on 
		- c373 
		- c376
- move alerts to linear tickets
- measure and define SLAs on v64 health in fleet clusters
- Build an agent (w/oak) to monitor health of new and existing clusters and identify major issues and regresions 
- a lot of folks have custom hwh codex 
	- heavy integration work is alr done 
- linear ticket
	- make a linear ticket of this cluster 
- sujith 
	- figure out strategy for manual validation 
	- vendor integration work 
	- if a node has been manually cordoned it somewhere - at least surface it 

questions:
- what is vd64 health 

### CW SYNC
AY-ree

- when we use the linear bot that tony built 
- how do we get guest access to linear 
- when we ask for drains it asks for approval
	- can we see fleet healthiness across all clusters
	- what is the right medium here

Apollo - inbound stack does fW upgrade

BMaaS APi as an alternative for BMC auth backoff

- what is our strategy for it
	- Maintenance for IB/rack level
	- 3 switches that went down 
		- maybe its not bad enough in the moment
### AWS
- stable id - End of Month
- repair granularity 
- api provided for node level repair 
- get a ticket from a similar cloud provider 

two paths
- error info 
	- could be an api 
		- personal health 
		- diff than describe block status
		- think it from the pov 
			- eg ur seeing some perf related issue 
			- look at describe capacity health spec
			- depends on stack
				- eg gpus r having problems
		- leading thought is more static
