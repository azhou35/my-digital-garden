detailed info on 


what do you guys think about 11/27/28 
give our recommendation 
avoid oai telling us that may 8 
dates are reasonable 
They need R2D approval which Kelly is getting
- Security scan on IB FW 
- R2D to upgrade existing clusters
Sign off on Monday

Back up date
- Plan B: May 5
	- We could update Host OS with vanilla
	- Pit stop model where we can update cluster under an hour 
	- Wouldt give them the new IB
	- Updating CX7 is still impactful 
- Johns team used to do this now their Chahandras
- Theyre waiting for validation of the version 
- Wait till the morning 

Rewiring for 61/62
