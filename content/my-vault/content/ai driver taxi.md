title: "ai driver taxi"
---

couple of contradictions:
- we prefer waymo over uber
	- features to not talk to uber driver
- there's this funny instance where a driver will start talking in a foreign language and im like ???
gone are the days of:
- talking to ur neighbor

we have an inherent distrust of
- strangers
the same time we start to trust
- 'curated' strangers

story:
- i get into my uber and they start talking in vietnamese to a ghost 
- an uber driver comments that no one ever talks to him 
	- he enthralls me w a story about his dead relatives coming to him in a dream
	- its the absurd that feels so real, like a slightly deranged uncle coming to u at new years
