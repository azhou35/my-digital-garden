i dont know if joining scale ai at the current moment is a good move for my career
i am very disillusioned and uninspired by microsoft day - to - day.
perhaps neither of these options are good for me. i just want to quit. 
i dont want to be like the people who i work with. comfortable and servicing a customer. 
i need to either take a risk or stay put where i am 
i feel quite unfulfilled and perturbed by the current situation
if i dont leave now i certainly will feel stuck doing menial operational work at microsoft
i feel stuck oh my god


i think i care too much about having good friendships
