8-12
start of head of bd


- engineers work on task

- background in data science and ml research in college
-  motivated by making it easier for everyone to access technical tools
	- love for writing ml curriculum and used a lot of kaggle data sets
- college i did work w developer advocacy as a technical writer at amazon documenting our sdks
- past 2 years in microsoft rlly reflect this 
	- from working on ai workload schedulers / (cloud native vs open source offering) 
	- to supporting openAI on its supercomputign workloads
- > “During an OpenAI escalation at Microsoft, I coordinated a live GPU maintenance window across 10,000+ nodes. We caught a bug mid-rollout, rerouted workloads within 6 minutes, and salvaged a training run with zero retraining cost. I documented the postmortem, and that now lives in our standard playbook for planned maintenance.”

> “What I learned is: reliability is about making tradeoffs legible. I’d bring the same energy here to make routing logic, cost, and risk feel visible and composable to every user.”


### Potential Questions
1. juggling diff projects / products
	1. it rlly is preserving your context switching skills and ur ability to self-manage and multi task 
	2. for a highly ambiguous autonomous task no on egives you a check list
	3. you create it and develop the intuition on what's right, but also rigorously document ot keep yoruself in check
	4. e.g. creating documentation is a perfect way to do this
		1. our teams are constantly diong maintenances and retros in tandem
		2. the devs are heads down debugging and i have to be meticulous about the data i collect
2. triage vs escalate
3. prioritization
	1. fast triage model
		1. helps to have dashboards, status trackers
4. Whats a time you drpoped the ball
5. systems that grow w the team 
	1. shared timeliens for enterprise onboardings
	2. centralizing known friction points 
6. general interest in ai
	1. at microsoft i see us moving the convo from training to inference, from pure model compute to orchestration - how we can make things controllable, visible, and reliable, aka enterprise grade

### Vision + Strategy
- how do metrics work at an open source company
SWOT Analaysis

- What part of the OpenRouter experience do you think creates the most loyalty from power users today—and how do you plan to double down on that? What’s something OpenRouter does today that competitors consistently underestimate?
- “OpenRouter’s model-agnostic API is clearly resonating—what do you see as the most defensible part of that offering as you move into enterprise?”
*Weaknesses*
- > **“As the team starts to scale and formalize workflows, where do you see the biggest gaps in operational clarity—handoffs, postmortems, prioritization?”**
- “What part of the enterprise motion feels most underbuilt today—technical onboarding, billing transparency, performance guarantees, something else?”
- “What are the friction points that keep OpenRouter from landing more large-scale enterprise or AI-native customers?
	- That’s helpful—at Microsoft, I’ve seen trust eroded when inference latency varies without warning. I’d be excited to help build whatever systems make that kind of risk legible to users upfront
	- retrofitting from enterprise to startup
- - > “How does OpenRouter plan to defend against becoming a thin passthrough layer in a space where every model vendor is also building their own APIs, pricing schemes, and routing features? Where do you see true defensibility emerging—from developer mindshare, observability tooling, enterprise trust, or something else?”
Opportunitties
- ***“How do you see the long-term opportunity evolving beyond routing—do you envision OpenRouter as part of a broader AI orchestration or observability layer?”***
	- ask about numbers, hiring goals, ARR

observability

*Threats*
-“How do you think about the risk of OpenRouter getting boxed in between model providers building their own routing tools and developer teams rolling their own?” 
- **“What do you see as the biggest threat to OpenRouter’s long-term relevance—vertical integration by model vendors, commoditization, or something else?”**
- “What operational gaps keep you up at night?”
- **“If you were advising a competitor trying to beat OpenRouter in the next 12 months, what would you tell them to build?”**


- “What’s the highest-risk assumption OpenRouter is making right now?”
- “What would it take for OpenRouter to become the Stripe of inference?”

- “If we landed a Fortune 100 client tomorrow, what would break?”


- “Where do you feel most alone in execution today?”
- “What kind of teammate would make your job 10% easier every week?”
