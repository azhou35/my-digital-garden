title: "Authentic People"
---

Definition:
* People who are genuinely interested in something (hobby, cause, intellectual interest)

Anti-definition:
* Those who are mimetic -- hopping on trends (often consumerist) that are easily influenced by what they see other people doing
* Those whose speech patterns/common topics I can immediately predict -- are we going to talk about our trave from the summer? Where we live in the city? What we like to do on the weekends? Whether or not we're going to move to Brooklyn? 
* Anyone who says their hobby is to travel -- aka consume passively other people's cultures 
*
