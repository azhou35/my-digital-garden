[[content/fourth of july|fourth of july]]

themes:
- my parents have always strove to help me "assimilate"

baseball game:
- my dad took me to my first baseball game in middle school. neither of us understood the rules of the game but we recognized how to play: consume a hot dog, procure a navy blue yankees hat, cheer when others did. 
- in summer laze we'd barbeque, of course. he'd buy packets of hamburgers and hot dogs for me, even when 
- we grew up in a white town that held weekend country shows.

*country roads* is one of my dad's unironically favorite songs. he recalled in uni, once a group of american exchange students visited and performed the song. america, a land he could only piece together from *charles dickens* and country songs. how could you imagine such vastness? 

which speak of great expanse and endless freedom, god what was this world captured in this song? 

there's music playing from a speaker. at times, country roads, miley cyrus, sweet home alabama. at the last one, this set of characters (who i've now imprinted on as if they were stars in a sitcom) gleefully perform their best efforts. at the chorus they break out into full out dance. the guys pumping at the sky, their collective voices into uproar. i feel like i'm witness to some version of ozark.

noticing my lingering eyes, my mom asks me if i have any like these folks. i laugh because she knows all my friends and who i get along with. we hold patriotism at an arm's length. cynicism is intellectual, or so we tell ourselves.

my mom laughs when i refer to white people as "wai guo ren." *that's you. you're american.*

i remember one time fourth of july, i felt very cold. seattle, 2022, the day after roe v wade was revoked. it felt incredibly hard, almost absurd, to be patriotic in the moment. a sentiment my peers share time-and-time again - when presidents we hate get elected. 

then again i care about china only because my parents care about china. 

i must also care about america if my parents care about it so.
