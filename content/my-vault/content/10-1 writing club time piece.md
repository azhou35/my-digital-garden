time dilation - 

*timepiece* (object as a portal)

there's nothing more performative than a watch on a girl who can't tell time. 

friday morning on mott street & i can't get the thought of a vintage gold watch out of my head - the night before i had rabbitholed into the recursive algorithmic feed Tik Tok has shoved down my throat like livestock. six minutes from the canal station i avoided the tourists flooding chinatown at the first prospect of warmth, routing to mike's watches.

the shop is empty, except for the balding asian man in the corner. it takes me a few minutes to fumble together my crinkled dollar bills at the same time as the clumsy mandarin, and i barely get out *手表* before he cuts me off -- don't worry, i can adjust whatever. which one? both? 

cheeks flushed & i shake my head wordlessly, and resume to staring at the mirror for an eternal decision on which one i thought would fit my wrist better. i tried to rack my brain for what the man from *watches of switzerland* had said all those years ago -- the watch face should be halfway the size of the wrist? no, a third? an ex-boyfriend obsessed with marks of luxury, dragged me from one watch store to another, pursuing some patek phillipe pipe-dream.

*i just need a quick fix. i don't need something that lasts.* the lies we tell ourselves.

mike, or so i think his name is mike, goes back to speaking **cantonese* to the locals who have pulled up. my gall to communicate has escaped me, but i extend my hand and allow him to fasten a watch onto my wrist. it's a beautiful thing, golden framed bezel and faux diamonds glittering in the store light.

there are certain turning points of life when your perception of time shifts. the numbness in the day after you graduate college. the gossamer stretch just before falling in love. mom says things shift after you have children, with a pointed look at me. 

humidity thickens the air to the point that time seems to feel unreal. in the break of summer heat, i feel restless. time feels slippery, an elusive thing that is constantly escaping my grasp. like some koi fish i struggle upstream against water that's going downwards. it's become some sort of game, trying to speedwalk through Chinatown: +1 point every time you narrowly avoid crashing into the grandma dragging their suitcase.

signs of age worry me. perhaps *terrify* is a better word here. they say you shouldn't smile to avoid wrinkles, but i can't help myself. i check my phone constantly, as if each glance could mak sixty seconds go by faster.

maybe because it's a harsh reminder of how differently time unfolds for my parents versus me - i am at the start of my career while theirs winds down. time dilates based on our gravitational pull to the world - in this strong gravitational field the currents pull me in and out. 

my parents pass down advice the way that others pass down family heirlooms. my dad never had to explicitly state *to be on time is to be late,* but he's imbued his sense of urgency. mom, however, needlessly reminds me to slow down. 

she keeps track of my life on a vintage red calendar, where she tears off each month with glee, the paper vanishing into time itself. *annie visits home* in chicken scrawl on the 17th, *pick up jason from airport*.

i find myself wandering, looking for a time machine. there's this running motif i parrot when i meet up with a friend after a month, something that goes like *the summer went by so fast.*

what makes a neighborhood timeless? 

chinatown, home of vintage watch shops and creaky fruit stands, traditional medicine outposts and plant shops watched over by lucky cats. it's a place that resists the passage of time, where it looks the same as when i visited in middle school to when my parents first moved, where momentum stands still, where the ancient traditional chinese characters stubbornly persist even in the face of simplification. i pop into a plant shop to procure a leafy orphan. there is a vintage red calendar that hangs within the thicket of green, and a plump orange cat that noses his way around the dank. 

i ask for a plant that requires little care and he points me to a shrub. without much of a green thumb, i know it won't last, but i just want a quick fix.

we have endless metaphors for time, the way it unspools, slips away, accelerates, how it physically moves and lurches forward like some wild animal. it's this thing we've invented and cant tame, name but can't place. 

time dilates and expands during moments of gravity. we cling onto artifacts as time pieces, anchors we try to hold for stability. we carry watches, keep calendars, repeat rituals, celebrate holidays. but we cannot control time itself: the closer we are to what anchors us, the slower time feels - and hen  

all humans want to do is control time. all they can do is build something that lasts. is this not why the egyptians built pyramids that would outpace their lifetime.

i am trying to outrun something and i don't know what it is - aging? a future grief? there's this dangerous exercise where i jump forward on the number line and work backwards from there. *if i want to be 30 when i hav my first child, i need to get to the peak of my career by then.* if my perception of time were a circle i inherit grief from a future pain, each moment i stay still.

am i going through time or is time going through me?

at your youngest: with only few years accumulated, each year matters more
at your oldest: with only a few years left, you hold onto every minute
the truth is im terrified of outliving my parents.
every year is taking the math to its final end - when im 30 theyll be 68. when im 35 theyll be 73. 
it already aches when they walk, their bodies already frail. 
a child's experience of time upturns when they realize how old their parents are.

maybe each day will only go faster from here. 
i mis sphysical calendars.
