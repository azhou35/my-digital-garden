cafe writing - pitiful cafe

thoughts:
* even a broken clock is right 2 times a day
* has prompting made us better at asking each other questions?

post-cafe jubilee thoughts:
* there is some demand to cultivate a "friend community" in nyc (bahar, justin, shirling)
* demand for a writing club / space to cultivate this writing practice (esther, who likes to write short stories)
* demand for future cafes (annie)
* cafe went off rlly well, operationally excellent and attention to detail and intentionality was called out
* questions: 
	* is there potential to do a monthly cafe cadence
	* future photo gallery idea?
	* should i make a instagram?
* good # of friends who can bake
* good # of friends who can take photos
notes:
[[generosity of time]]

revisited [[random walk series]] - to pursue March 10?
