title: "how to lose a friend"
---


1. stare at the wall lost in the flurry of previous friendship breakups - your art class partner in middle school, the girl who showed you how to jump rope for the first time, are you really, really sure? 
2. write down a list of all the things you like about your friend. then a list of what you dislike. not dislike, but maybe, what triggers that little feeling when you want to feel annoyed but the person doesn't owe you anything so you can't reasonably get annoyed. you'll find that the one on the left should far outweigh the right, which is silly little things like "*they're constantly late*" and ""
3. maybe, the losing-a-dear-friend process has already kicked off, and you're knee-deep in it and you realize *oh shit i don't want this to happen but maybe it's meant to be? is this the way the river flows?*
4. ghost their messages, again and again, because you're avoiding the sinking feeling that perhaps you two have outgrown each other.
5. the only truth is that there is never needs to be real reason to walk away from a friendship. which means all the more to continually choose to show up. 
6. Such is the cruelty and beauty of life that we seek connection and then move on.
