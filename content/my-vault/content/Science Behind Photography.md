#### Why does the camera struggle with high contrast situations?
Cameras struggle with high contrast situations due to their limited dynamic range, which affects their ability to capture both bright highlights and dark shadows. In such scenes, highlights can become overexposed and lose detail, while shadows may be underexposed and appear too dark. The camera’s metering system often averages light across the scene, leading to suboptimal exposure settings and potential color inaccuracies. To mitigate these issues, photographers often use techniques like HDR imaging or graduated neutral density filters.

#### Why is the human eye better at processing light?
The human eye processes high contrast scenes much differently than a camera. Our eyes have a wider dynamic range, allowing us to perceive details in both bright highlights and dark shadows simultaneously. The eye's iris adjusts quickly to changes in light, and our brains constantly adapt to varying light conditions, helping us interpret scenes more accurately. Additionally, the human visual system can focus on different areas of a scene, enhancing our ability to see details in both highlights and shadows. In contrast, cameras capture a single exposure at a time, which can lead to loss of detail in extreme lighting conditions.
The cornea and camera lenses both focus light but do so differently. The cornea is a transparent, curved layer that refracts light to focus it on the retina, filtering some wavelengths, especially UV rays. It works with the eye's lens, which adjusts shape for focus, providing a dynamic response to distance. In contrast, camera lenses can be changed or adjusted but don't adapt in real-time. The cornea allows for a wide field of view, while camera lenses offer varying fields of view based on design. Additionally, the eye maintains a relatively constant depth of field, whereas camera lenses allow for explicit control over depth of field through aperture settings. Overall, the eye's system is more adaptable, providing a fluid visual experience.
