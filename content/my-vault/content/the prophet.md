Kahlil Gibran
> _Work is love made visible._
> 
> _And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy._
> 
> _For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man’s hunger._
> 
> _And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distills a poison in the wine. And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man’s ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night._
