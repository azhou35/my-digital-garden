	* - In NYC, some plazas attract crowds, but most don't.
	- Many plazas are only used as walkways, with young office workers as their primary users.
	- Plazas influence urban life, with sociable ones being the most popular.
	- High proportions of women in well-used plazas signal their sociability.
	- People gravitate toward crowded areas but avoid standing in the middle, preferring pillars or edges.
	- Movement patterns in plazas mirror those observed in other societies, as shown by Jan Gehl's study on self-congestion.
	- Research by Ciolek found social interactions often occur near traffic lines, not in isolated spaces.
	- Streets and parks should blend seamlessly.
	- Parks encourage spontaneous use but should not feel too enclosed or too exposed.
	- Concerns about homelessness can deter use.
	- Triangulation (e.g., sculptures) creates shared stimuli that promote interaction among strangers.
