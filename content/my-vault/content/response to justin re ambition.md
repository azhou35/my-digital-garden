* i wouldnt outwardly call myself ambitious, but as someone constantly striving 
* we are people who are looking for our **life's work** -- before we get to our magnus opus is a series of failed pivots 
* i'm looking for the thing that will define my career

that day i was walking jainil's dog with mahesh, he asked me when i felt on top of the world from a career high. honestly, i didnt have anything to say from my internships/job, but the first image that came to mind was when i was hosting events in high school and post-grad: the hackathon i incepted in junior high school, bookbear matchmaking event, picnic. i'm still searching for that  high, where i feel like i create something out of nothing and it actually has impact. the scope doesn't even have to be that big -- something like event planning is localized to the people i know.
