title: "normal computing"
---

intro 
just got back from a week in sf for a customer offsite
- _"Hi, I’m Annie Zhou. I’m currently a TPM at Microsoft, where I focus on supercomputing operations and software orchestration for AI workloads. I have a strong background in coordinating complex cross-functional projects involving hardware and software, and I’m especially interested in opportunities where I can drive high-impact, exploratory initiatives that bridge AI infrastructure and product innovation. I’m excited to learn more about Normal Computing’s work in thermodynamic computing and the kinds of special projects your team is tackling." managing reliability, orchestration, and software-driven ops for 5K+ H100/H200 GPUs. Also worked across finance and healthcare enterprises on their workload scheduler strategy. That’s given me deep exposure to how AI infrastructure operates at scale, but also how brittle and complex it is today. I've always found my strength in bridging the technical and the nontechnical, and I love working directly with the customer,  from building dashboards and automations to shipping multi-agent Copilot architectures based on genomics use cases.
- been a good experience seeing ai infra at scale 
- was chatting w nikhiita 
- interesting position biggest bottlenecks in scaling AI workloads on existing infrastructure, even when you have all the gpus in the world
	- memory bandwidth, interconnect latency, and workload orchestration
- 
- seeing process from buildout 


segue 
"I’ve been following the AI hardware space closely and have some familiarity with work from Microsoft (Maia chip), Groq, Cerebras, and Etched. I’m really interested in how Normal Computing’s thermodynamic approach differentiates itself and what unique opportunities that creates for special projects."


bg in dc buildout
- - What do you see as the biggest opportunity for Normal Computing in the next 2–3 years?
- “Where do you think the market misunderstands what we’re building?”
- role of product
	- where do you see someone w a mix fo technical and nontchnical skills play ehre
- What are some special projects you doing 
- tradeoffs in CN101's design 
- key challenges moving from simulation/prototypin/tape-out 
- how does chip plan to integrate with existing ai infra/frameworks 
- what sort of customers are you working w here
- product managers
