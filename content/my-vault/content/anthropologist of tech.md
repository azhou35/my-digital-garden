I think anthropology is about very close observation, and specifically, observation as distinct from judgment.

I used to write a lot of op-eds and hot takes, but to take an anthropological approach, you have to turn off that part of your brain. You instead dial up the ability to pay attention—to eavesdrop, to write down details, and to ask questions—without immediately forcing everything into a narrative.

There is a famous anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, who coined the term ‘thick description.’ His point was that ‘a wink is never just a wink.’ When you parachute into a new or strange culture, you realize that every handshake and every ritual isn’t just a random quirk; it has real significance. It tells you who has high status in the community or what values people hold.

She was very attentive to media and how it shaped culture. One of her most famous books is On Photography. She looked at how photography—one of the most transformative technologies of her time—changed how the public understood the news and empathized with each other.

The point of Interact is to provide a non-instrumental space for ambitious young people. It’s about escaping the rat race and venture capital and social media clout, and connecting with each other on a deeply human level—whether that’s playing in a stream, book clubbing philosophy, or talking about love lives late at night.
