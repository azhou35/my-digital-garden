energy valve - enable 
probability that failures malfunction

- what is the impact
- repair this wall for any reason 
- ag 
- hpc team
- flow sensor
- still flow is good

if the valve for oai 
- we need to go thru plannedmaintenance
- non critical customers - defined sla 
- that anvil send a node to customer
if the repair that doesnt happen for a couple weeks
- telemetry data that is coming out of regiwall is broken 
- we are flying blind
- flow sensor gone run
- - if we dont repair it
- we cant 
- only the rack
	- all the nodes on the 18 racks

give us a kusto query to add it into our dashboard

compute fabric - which maintains status of nodes 
when ur taking something to repair
status has to be moved back to ofr the rack
when we get time window from oai, to repair that device, need to move to ofr 
how we do that 


check for this alert which comes from error state
added the decooling time 
any of these error 
how to map these fault codes
regular flow - inform anvil and we let know data cycle
dont want to generate gdc ticket
