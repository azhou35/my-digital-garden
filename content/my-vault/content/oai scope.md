1) Own entire lifecycle of compute
	1) DC racks -> researcher scheduling
2) Infra as a service 
	1) Predictable/reliable/automated loops
3) Firefighting 
	1) Unplanned events - noticing patterns and turn one-off crises into system improvemens

Biggest bottleneck: compute reliability
if there are no bad psus if theyre being single sourced
- check w dc team - make sure there are bad psus for phx27/28
	- potential impact - let saagar know there could be impact
	- have the inventory of bad psus 
	- phsycial check 
	- get the schie team to do a quick check
- phx11 - full utility loss across everything 
	- there could be a transient loss 
	- scott heath 
	- theoreitcally shouldnt be impact but wanna double check
	- austin should know if load will ride thru 
	-

- thid event - single sourcing event that shouldnt 
	- is it only one of the PDUs and not both the sources 
	- if its only one

1 PDU will be isolated

phx11 shouldnt be any transient loss
