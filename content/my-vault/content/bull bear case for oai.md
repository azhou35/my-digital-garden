title: "bull bear case for oai"
---

bear case:
- i suck at the job, its 996 and i am drowning and cant handle the stress
- i burn out from trying to travel to nitin so often 
- i cant handle being apart from nitin and our relationship essentially goes on pause 
- we break up because we cant see an end to the distance 
- im pigeon holed into the tpm role and i cant get to product 
- i get further and further from taste/craftsmanship 

bull case:
- the aura of being a young new grad at openai is insane and will open up doors that i cant even imagine
- i end up doing well in the job and thriving - fast promo, no beuracracy, just outcomes 
- me and nitin survive the year, i am able to visit often enough 
- i learn an incredible amount from oai and even tho its challenging they trust me enough to execute 
- i am able to get this sf itch out of my system and see what its like even for a year
	- will never have this "what if" feeling 
- i make a shit ton of money and develop credibility within circles for working on the hardest / pressing infra problem to ai today 
- just learn a lot from researchers
- i exit after 1 yr and no job is deniable from me - i can go to anything i want in nyc (like pm at anthropic or something ese of the sort, pm at google deepmind, pm at something)



between a job of a lifetime or a person of a lifetime
- what do you have more conviction in?
