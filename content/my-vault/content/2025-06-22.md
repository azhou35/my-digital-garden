if i stay at microsoft i need to find a more fulfilling project to plug into 
- send message to various ppl across microsoft to learn more about site reliability dashboards, telemetry, gpu products, 
	- putting site reliability in front of operations
- prototype something to echibit my specialized generalist moat - infra + data analytics

learnings from today:
site reliability engineer is a sysadmin who applies software engineering principles to it ops aka making distributed systems reliable aka someone who ixes production issues)

at microsoft batch + cyclecloud are general purpose compute orchestration
whereas modal + baseten are highly opinionated workload orchestration for inference serving
-> azure ml managed enpoints is azures attempt to own this inference layer

i am deeply interested in scientific/technological progress. 

*But after diving into AI infra, I noticed a huge gap: GPU monitoring in multi-cloud environments is woefully insufficient.*

a general question - how can systems-level thinking + observability help predict failures? 

casual observability for ai pipelines 
autonomous ai factory control loops 

> human-intensive reliability engineering 
> specifically from supercomputing experience
> ai ops labor shortage
> self-driving ai infra could command huge budget

systems-level telemetry
workload-health casualty


gaps:
- as systems scale its so much harder for human sres to debug failure cascade
- monitoring =/= control 
real-time autonomous supply chain resilience

> **“As highly complex AI infrastructure proliferates, systems-level telemetry + causal inference + predictive control loops will be a core value layer — but GPUs are just one domain. The same core ideas apply across AI pipelines, AI factories, global supply chains, and sovereign cloud systems.”**


i am intrigued by chaos theory and how change propagates across a system. 
supply chain cascades is a great example - was so fascinated when jasmine said that she checked gas prices bc of the uncoming war with iran. 

massive, multi-layered physical or cyber-physical systems where weak signals propagate, failures cascade, and the human operators can't keep up anymore
physical supply chain & manufacturing plants

i'm interested in industries of this dna:
- complex interdependent systems w weak-signal failure modes
- high cost of unplanned downtime or safety risk
- existing but fagmented telemetry footprint
- willingness to invest in predictive/autonomous control
- large enough market for vc-backable opportnity 

weak-signal failures with a high cost of downtime 
example verticals:
- discrete manufacturing (automotive & eletronics assembly)
