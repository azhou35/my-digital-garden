The first time I did _n+1_’s Bookmatch ([which is going on now!](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/n1-foundation-inc/bookmatch-2024)) there was a question that asked whether you read to learn about the world or to escape from it. I chose the former, but to be more accurate, I learn about the world in order to escape from it.
