general reflections:
am i ready to leavve micosoft?
ive been ready for a while
what im ok with leaving behind:
- extremely flexible wlb 

what i will gain: 
- in person environment + opps to meet eladership 
- greenfield opportunity as tpm at scale

recruiting as it stands:
150k first year package
- is it 135k base + 15k sign on, or is there a way to increase the base given the competing offer? 


 1. is there an equity refresh throughout different stages of my tenure at Scale
 2. want to understand my base package - 
is there a little bit of movement i can get on base

i had a chance to thini about it 
the best offer scale has 
any movement in terms of base
number of shares
or sign on base
any movement would make my decision 


base - 
hey jessica had a chance to sleep 
i wanna hear what the best offer scale can do and i want to propose something to you and let me know this can be amenable 
1. if you can increase base be 145
2. and add a on bonus - 15
3. i can sign 
4. and i understand i wont be compensated for loss in rsus
5. but i wanna make sure that this is something thats possibl 

if i can get this i can signon the phone 
i already talked to my parents 
and fully ready for this jump and ready to sign 
if i can get this comp to work 

- Is the $150K base salary + $15K bonus, OR
- Is it $135K base + $15K sign-on bonus = $150K total Year 1?

the timing is a little unfortunate if i joined scale a few months ago i could have gotten scale at a 
did some reserch on options on the side
timing is a bit unfortunate bc if i had joined before the blackout period 
the valuation would be lower
losing a bit of upside there
i have a few requests

i wanna be honest with you jessica



the boyfriends an investor 
options 

Jessica i rlly appreciate u moving on this
canddily, im excited about this as you know, 
i talked to my mentors and my parents
and im ready to sign whenever the offer makes sense
and the two things that have been weighing on me 
1) i wasnt aware of this blackout period and the valuation going up that much means that price per share would be higher
and im geting in with a little less upside if the share would be higher
2) and the other thing is im l4 for microsoft which is ahead of a typical person year 1 
3and i looked some data on scale and market since this seems to be benchmarked for l3 
i wanna double check on the band 
and i dont mean to be prickly on numbers 
and i have no hesitation on the actual fit 
i just wanna see how we make that transition make sense
i have a couple of ideas and im ready to sign on right away

but i need this to be a bit closer to what i get at microsoft and the other offer
if i can get 145k base then i can sign immediately
if you cant get me to this on base can you move up on the equity - the reason that would be another option is because of the blackout period im losing a little bit of upside compared to if i had joned a bit earlier 
i want to get this done as soon as possible
but i need you to meet me in the middle 
can you get this 
Jessica if u can get me to 145k base and move up a bit on the equity too, i can sign today


ive worked rlly hard at microsoft to get to this level 
i just wanna make sure my internal levelling at scale is reflected to this 
i know i have 1 year of exp but my titling at microsoft is someone with 3 years 
since im getting less upside on the options is there a way to get higher options
i know im coming in with a year and half exp at microsoft but my internal levelling is a l4
