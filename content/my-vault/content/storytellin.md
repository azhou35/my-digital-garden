Storytelling is a theme across media that I deeply admire, and am constantly looking for inspiration and role models. 
## Poets
Poetry is that ever-enduring love that I can't quite explain. It stirs an awe deep within me, something that feels inherently human.

### Authors
When it comes to narrative, the first thing I notice is the prose. Characters second, and then at last, probably plot/conflict. As a result I gravitate towards MFA-esque purple prose (see: [IN DEFENSE OF PURPLE PROSE - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/books/in-defense-of-purple-prose.html)). 
A part of me also yearns for high-concept humanist sci-fi, essentially anything that tickles the same brain cells that Ted Chiang does.

> On Purple Prose: 
> Good prose offers more than the train ride. Good prose has things happening on the train and outside it. Its windows are open, and it asks its riders to look at the scenery, the towns, the people, to understand that we're not just moving from one point to another, but that the things in between count, and that they add substance to the ride. We aren't going from point A to point B, we're going from Oslo to Bergen, watching the seasons change, watching people live, watching nature attack the landscape. This is the point behind good purple prose.

### Musical Artists
I listen to music for lyrics first and rhythm second.
