timeline:

Idea #1 
- i leave on wed night -> red eye
- Thurs Fri Sat half of Sunday
i come back on Sunday afternoon, arrive night time
or Tuesday early morning, arrive by morning 
then do Wed Thurs Fri 

tell kenny that im talking to sierra 
fireworks pm 
once i gotoffer turned that down 
to me between these two
here in sf bc of sierra
completely diff role but its forward deployed based
be very casual






excited by the offer
excited to join
touched base w phuong for a sec 
some things have changed
Hey when i started this process
my parents were always on the older side
it was a thing in the back of my mind 
but as tihs process continued
this immune illness happened
they live in the city
and im going to be pushed to a much more caretakery position 
and not its something that i anticipated 
and its weighing in my mind
in some ways its a dream job in some extent
so i wanna try my best work something out and be creative 
while also being there for my family


im aware its important to be in office
i talked to phuong and know a fully remote role isnt possible but we could be creative about it 
i wonder if something like 2 weeks in sf 
2 weeks in the new york office

i worked w saagar
he also emphasized how important it was to be in person 
but obviously hes in san diego and hes made it work 
ik hes coming in a lot more junior 
i promsie theres no shortcomings 
and i wil bring myself to work 

i know i todl phuong this im evaluating a tpm role in ny 

or 1 week in 2 months
		4) 8-9 days 
hey 
1) i want this to work out
2) im ready to make sacrifices
3) i want to know what the most flexible option is 

would love to ask about some things im cautious about 
- 2 things
	- i know we talked about this role being more senior
		- im fully of the faith yeas of exp dont correlate w execution 
		- but im still curious
	- also tenure / churn on tpm side 


30 days - learn the business
