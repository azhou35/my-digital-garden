中秋节

9.0.5
pre-autumn should be a season of its own.  summer heat waves and never-ending daylight seem eternal, until one day, it's 7PM and you notice the sky darkened. the thickness of summer gives way to the promise of change: a pop of yellow spotted on my daily run through battery park, the fuji apples proliferating the produce aisle, the breeze that feels *crisp* in every sense of the word. there's a japanese phrase for this breeze: aki no kaze, the end of summer, when the wind of autumn hits your skin and you sense the season is changing. aki meaning autumn and akiru meaning to lose interest -- akikaze ga tatsu is an idiom for when the chill air means that affections are waning.

in this secret fifth season dwells one of my favorite holidays, mid-autumn festival. held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese calendar, it coincides with the full moon. growing up, the first sign of autumn wasn't the overload of pumpkin-flavored-everything at trader joe's -- it was the population of mooncakes popping up at our local asian market. we'd grab a couple boxes and my mom would thrust several dense cakes to bring to lunch and share with friends. 

mooncakes are, by design, never intended for a single eater. they're palm-shaped disks with thin pastry crust hugging a rich, thick filling -- typically lotus seed or red bean paste. they're not something you'd take a bite from: instead, you cut them into little wedges and distribute with a cup of hot tea. with mooncakes, you have two options: you can either share them with someone, or give it away.

in third grade, our chinese school held a kite competition for our midautumn. fearful of the wind, i never picked up a kite, but i summoned up the courage and let the taut line cut into my fingertips as i squinted at the sky. call it beginner's luck or some auspicious moon spirit, but i emerged as the only kite standing. the prize was a scooter but my mother saw the falls before they could happen and gave me only one choice -- give it away. so i gave it at the time, thinking that it would be our secret shared thing. 

when i was in college, this holiday coincided with the point of time where the new-semester-euphoria wore off and a mild homesickness settled in. freshman year my parents paid the ridiculous shipping fee to ship hefty tin boxes. that year was the pandemic when many meals were eaten alone; yet still i shared, six feet apart, with friends i had just met weeks before. squatted up in some abandoned classroom, we jostled with plastic knives and paper plates. no one in the room knew that we wouldn't see each other the year afterwards -- or that we would still be friends three years after that. 

come next mid-autumn, i was in a different college, different state, different state of mind. my parents sent me a different variant: thousand-layer mooncakes (teochew), which came as layered pastry hugging a sweet taro paste. this time i brought it to new friends in the dining hall -- we gathered around molding wood, slumped from a deluge of prelims and disappointing club tryouts. energy was low as i grabbed metal utensils to attempt to pierce the flaky skin, which cut up into unappetizing misshapen pieces. drained from our stress over classes and clubs, we didn't have much appetite. 

that night of the full moon, i felt a certain hollowness i couldn't articulate. i was still hungry even after eating. but on the way back to my dorm room i picked up a surprise package from my friends the year before. therein lay a single mooncake: a beautifully golden variant which promised a molten custard filling. over facetime i unpacked my gift with these friends, who had called me from their own celebration all the way in pittsburgh. this mooncake evolved to be so tiny its impossible to split, but perfect to give away. 

on my first mid-autumn in the city i was adamant i wanted to celebrate. *aki no kaze* pricked my skin and i knew i wanted to envelop myself with warmth. something about autumn is incredibly nostalgic. i used to share mooncakes at chinese school with three girls, all whom i once considered quite close. at a high school reunion i talk to my old best friend for the first time in five years. neither of us remember the scooter but she says she remembers how flowery and beautifully i wrote back then, and i tell her how logical and precise her philosophy always was. with another good friend we squint a two bright beams in the sky and wonder if it's moonlight: we conclude it's just some industrial light fixture. with the third we promise each other to grab drinks. i always leave these conversations hungry. 

with friends, you have two options: give or share. there is so much i want to share with others: inside jokes, my favorite foods, even my other friends. and there's so much to inevitably give: your time, your hopes, and, your mutual friends. i've been thinking a lot about my friends, how they come from different parts of my life and how i try to hold onto them. 

my intentions to host events during holidays are to capture this nostalgia and share it with others. to revel in nostalgia and tradition for a few precious hours. this year we make try our hand at making snowskin mooncakes, a deceptively simple recipe of mochi exterior and custard interior. 


why am i hosting events?



capturing a nostalgic event

mooncakes symbolize fullness,
