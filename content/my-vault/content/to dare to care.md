		- seen how students are more and more self-conscious of trying - surveillance culture around social media
			- they would see "i want to be a good writer / poet" but it's a bit cringe 
				- i dont't want to be perceived as trying and attempting to achieve my dreams
				- fear of judgement
				- perform cynicism - it can be misread as intelligence
				- you are disaffected, you are too cool, you've seen it all
				- you are so deeply hungry for sincere, earnest work
				- do it privatey bc they do it privately they're actualy trying to do something
				- among peers sincerity is whwat we deeply hunger for 
				- teachers have a role to set the stone and steward sincerity, judgement-free zone to allow folks to be sincere and earnest and it wont be cringe
				- and liberate them to their true selves
	- once i accept that i am cringe, i was free to become my true self 
	- personal anecdote - storing away my poems and writing in google docs that i revealed to key friends, and humiliated when our friendship fell through
