### Small Talk
- just got back from travel 
- getting back into running 
- yk i was actually on a run with my friend yesterday and mentioned i had this interview coming up and he actually knew you 
- casually mention you both know mahesh murag 

### Intro
Great to meet you! I’m Annie — I grew up in Jersey, studied data science at Cornell, and first fell in love with building products through making tools for fellow students. My background started in early AI research in computer vision and ethics, and I’ve stayed excited about building in this space where technical systems meet real-world impact. I took semester off to work as a PM at a legal tech startup where I got my first taste of startup life.

After graduation, I joined Microsoft’s AI infrastructure team — first working on batch inference for genomics and fintech workloads, and now supporting supercomputing for OpenAI’s training and inference clusters. 
Along the way, ive seen pain points from the infra pov from the restrictve nature of our hyperscaler platform to how hard it is to orchestrate gpus at scale. im really excited by what the emerging inference platforms are building, hence where we are today - i cold dmed ray and he was happy to chat bout product at fireworks.


### Case
If its Product design...
Structure: Ask clarifying questions → Diagnose problem → Set goals/metrics → Prioritize solutions → Test hypothesis

if it's general.. [[content/pm behaviorals|pm behaviorals]]
### Questions 
1. Outlook of a PM for an inference platform - how do you make tradeoffs
2. One thing Ive seen as a PM in this space is being opinionated about infra - what is the big bet that Fireworks is making? 
3. Are there types of users (e.g., indie devs vs AI infra teams) you’re trying to better serve right now?
4. The cool thing about this model space is how much better the performance gets every day - How do you think about building enduring product moats in a space where model performance is converging and infrastructure is increasingly commoditized
5. “Given where the team is now, what would you want someone in this role to own in the first 90 days? What kind of initiative would really stand out?”
