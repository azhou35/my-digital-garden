By the end of Q1 we will have maintenances across all our CSPs in all shapes and sizes - gradual maintenances across 2 GCP clusters (3052, 1947), regular IB maintenances across Azure clusters, full-cluster Azure updates for FW1.3 on GB200s, rolling power maintenances for CW-Direct and CW-GCP. We need to be prepared to execute maintenances in a predictable and reliable manner, agnostic of scope or SKU or CSP.

Throughout Q1, maintenance will be in constant background of the fleet: e.g. gradual maintenances across GCP clusters, routine IB maintenances across Azure, full-cluster firmware updates for GB200s (FW1.3), and rolling power maintenances across CW-Direct and CW-GCP.

In steady state, this means we must be able to execute maintenance predictably and reliably, regardless of CSP, SKU, or scope. Our systems should absorb this inevitable variability while minimizing sev-level company impact, reducing human engineer hours, all while optimizing for the FW/SW homogeneity of our fleet.
without requiring bespoke coordination, manual babysitting, or sev-level intervention.
