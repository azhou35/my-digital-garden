title: "azure copilot for batch"
---

summary use case made me think that there is potentially another persona: start-ups looking to build a cloud service that could leverage copilots. (thought of this b/c I heard there are a lot of AI startups in the biomedical space.)

Yes... their profile would be very similar to an ISV - but the onboarding/GTM could be different and even is highly similar, would be managed by different orgs w/in MSFT. (E.g., Partner group vs AI start-up group)
#### **1. Financial Services Industry (FSI) Customers**

- **Societe Generale (SG):** The team is actively engaging with SG to gather feedback on Azure Batch and discuss how HPC Copilot could automate workflows and improve operational efficiency. SG is a major Batch user, and their input is helping shape both the Batch roadmap and Copilot features. The engagement includes meetings with SG’s technical and sales teams to understand incidents, requests for evolution, and blockers in their current workflows.
