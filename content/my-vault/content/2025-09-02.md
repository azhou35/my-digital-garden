1. Writing instructors love to talk about “stakes.” Competent prose isn’t enough. A story must answer: _Why does this matter to the author, the reader, the world at large?_
2. 1. AI hallucinates, humans misremember. Yet neuroscience suggests that memory and imagination are one and the same. As Demis Hassabis’s [PhD thesis](https://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/1096238/22752296/1369317078327/DemisHassabisThesis.pdf) found, amnesiacs make shoddy novelists.

is memory a store
Preliterate oral cultures relied on mnemonic. Stories centered “heavy” figures like dramatic heroes and villains, and morals were imported through simple sayings and memes. If an idea wasn’t remembered, it didn’t exist. Because nothing was recorded, speech was inseparable from the setting it was conveyed in; the speaker’s gestures, intonations, and status all played a core role. Then, after writing was invented, language focused on precision and fact: memory was no longer a problem, but an expanded vocabulary was needed to make up for lost social context. Written texts also allowed knowledge to exist separate from its author. It gave rise to key scientific values like objectivity and falsifiability; to independent thinking and Enlightenment contrarianism. Without the written word, you can’t ponder someone's idea in quiet, alone. Writing birthed the heretic.


Email to Saagar
Hey Saagar, 

Hope you had a good weekend! 
Wanted to let you know I'm interviewing for this role on the GPU Compute Infrastructure - really excited about this opportunity and want to put my best foot forward. 
Email to Vishal:

I’m Annie from Azure Compute, where I’ve been working with Saagar on Planned Maintenance for OAI’s H100/H200 SKUs. Really appreciated your note back in July—it was great to hear about your experience with our team.

I’m exploring a TPM role on the GPU Compute Infra team with Kenny and wanted to give you a heads-up, as I’m excited about the opportunity to join your team and want to put my best foot forward. Just wanted to give you a heads-up and want to put my best foot forward. 

Cheers,
Annie

**Hi Saagar,**

I’m exploring a TPM role on the GPU Compute Infra team with Kenny and wanted to give you a heads-up, as I’m excited about the opportunity to join your team and want to put my best foot forward. Wanted to give you a heads-up and would love any tips you have for navigating the process.

Appreciate your insights!

I even treasure the imperfection of human [memory](https://jasmine.substack.com/p/internet-archive); one of my favorite

 [short stories](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/an-advanced-readers-picture-book-of-comparative-cognition/) reflects on the narrator’s attempt to remember his departed wife. He writes:
> I can’t remember the dress she wore or what she had bought; I can’t remember what we did for the rest of that afternoon; I can’t re-create the exact timbre of her voice or the precise shapes of her features, the lines at the corners of her mouth or the name of her perfume. I only remember the way sunlight through the kitchen window glinted from her forearm, an arc as lovely as her smile.
> 
> A lit forearm, laughter, food of the gods. Thus are our memories compressed, integrated into sparkling jewels to be embedded in the limited space of our minds. A scene is turned into a mnemonic, a conversation reduced to a single phrase, a day distilled to a fleeting feeling of joy.
> 
> Time’s arrow is the loss of fidelity in compression. A sketch, not a photograph. A memory is a re-creation, precious because it is both more and less than the original.

auto tune process


1. Project Retrospective / Technical Deep Dive I was asked to prepare a slide deck walking through a complex technical program I had led. The focus seems ob decision-making, stakeholder alignment, and managing the program The interviewer expected clear articulation of impact, technical structure, and mechanisms. 2. Cross-Functional Collaboration This was a STAR-format interview focused on how I’ve worked across diverse teams. I was asked about aligning conflicting priorities, translating between technical and non-technical teams, and managing through ambiguity. The discussion leaned toward how collaboration approaches. 3. TPM Process Design This was a scenario-based discussion. I was given a high-level challenge — e.g., launching a new model or product under safety constraints and tight timelines — and asked how I would manage and structure process. The interviewer looked for structured thinking, stakeholder mapping, risk identification, and how I would design scalableo design processes. 4. Hiring Manager / Values This round was focused on working style, values, and motivation. I was asked about how I navigate ambiguity, what kind of team culture I thrive in, and what drives to want to join openAI. What Stood Out: • OpenAI looks for TPMs who can bridge technical, non-technical, and research domains — and who can lead in highly ambiguous, high-stakes contexts. • There’s a strong emphasis on TPMs being builders of process and translators of complexity — not just project trackers. • Expect deep conversations around openAI products and models. The interview process was engaging, mission-driven, and respectful throughout.


he asked “if you had to do this project faster what would you have done differently?”
