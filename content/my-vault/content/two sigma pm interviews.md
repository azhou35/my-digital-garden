title: "two sigma pm interviews"
---

This would be a more in depth PM interview, but will of course leave time for you to learn more about product at Two Sigma.
Give an example of when you launched a product from 0-1. How did you recognize the problem you were solving? Describe trade-offs and alternative solutions that you decided against, creative process, how you broke down the problem, how you handed it off to engineering, how did the launch go? What metrics did you use to measure success?
What are some technical projects you worked on? How would you source data for X product

Nick - 
Microsoft
- 5 years on Bing
- internal big data platform stuff
- search quality
- applied ML 
- specific metrics 
- resarch platform for analysts to make ml models
	- where models are moving 
	- three years ago 
	- switched to a different side 
	- builds out taking predction of market and create portofio 
	- abstract data sci -> portfolio investments
- why does that one stand out

### About Me
 > “ I’'ve been a TPM at Microsoft AI Infra where I'm driving supercomputing infra for OpenAI’s training and inference workloads — managing reliability, orchestration, and software-driven ops for 5K+ H100/H200 GPUs. Also worked across finance and healthcare enterprises on their workload scheduler strategy. That’s given me deep exposure to how AI infrastructure operates at scale, but also how brittle and complex it is today. I've always found my strength in bridging the technical and the nontechnical, and I love working directly with the customer,  from building dashboards and automations to shipping multi-agent Copilot architectures based on genomics use cases.
 
 Product Design
 clarifying questions
 build internal tooling to support key workflows
 - one researcher  using dozens of tools 
 - lot of data vendors in the world
 - most data is not useful unless we can link it to financial asset
 - dozen of assets - stock ticker
 - two sigma id 
 - internal tracking across multiple systems

great dataset for the vendor
- manually identify how to l
- how to automate this process into linking 
- data vendor - some way of indexing their data 
- no one outside has the two sigma standard 
- data set has someone 
- edge case - not a known standard
	- hard mode 
- key dimensions
- many quantitative researchers
- internally 
- this is step 1 
- to making that dataset is usable


 scope 
 User interface 
algorithm design
large numbers
one dataset would be used by one researcher 
user of input
centralized datastore where datasets can go
how you hand it off 

how do we extract the third party 


interesting user experience with key decisions on how would you 
most of data 
data vendors create most crazy 
folder structure for every company
folder

a vendor has chosen to index data
all the rows will be linked 
one column w 
extract the vendor ids
- what is vendor id and what is teh standard
full auto 

diff standards have the same value 

#### Questioins
1. Company size
2. small companies
	1. prioritization
	2. highest impact thing
	3. everyone agrees on good, what is great
3. maurity of product domain
4. 0% true
	1. what is the next step 
	2. is to become a faang pm
5. whiplash
6. more identical is 
	1. value add 
	2. learn a space, domain, eng isde
### 
Queestions
- “How do you measure success for PMs working on internal platforms?”
- - “What traits make PMs successful in a quant-driven environment?”
- audience is small
- tool that organically gets 30 ppl and adoption
	- 2x value
	- pms not do a lot of gtm
- we dont force anyone to use tools
- 2) a good pm can synthesize these views and translate it to related
	- not the highest value thing
	- user pain points
- theres a risk of problem of the day 
	- hype value 
- successful pms hands on with research style workflows
- really hard to build researh workload
	- doesnt mean value 
    
- “How do PMs influence strategy or product vision in a company that is very data-driven?”
    
- “What’s something you wish PMs understood better about how the company works?”
- how does product strategy unfold at two sigma
- when ur users are quants 
- How was Microsoft PM culture -> Two Sigma 
- “At Microsoft, PMs often work across large cross-functional teams. How does collaboration with engineers and data scientists differ at Two Sigma?”
- how have u seen pm evovld
1) % of succcessful matchups
	1) time acceptable
	2) given we 
2) edge cases - where we look it up

#### What product would you build
### 1. **Internal Data Platform**

- **Purpose:** Centralize massive datasets (market, alternative data, research data) so quants and data scientists can access, query, and analyze them efficiently.
    
- **Features:**
    
    - Searchable datasets with metadata and quality indicators
        
    - Versioning and lineage tracking
        
    - Integration with analysis pipelines (Python, R, SQL)
        
    - Access controls and audit logs
        
- **PM Challenges:** Prioritizing features vs. ease of use, scaling infrastructure, ensuring data quality.

### 3. **Research Collaboration Platform**

- **Purpose:** Enable researchers and quants to share models, experiments, and results efficiently.
    
- **Features:**
    
    - Model versioning and reproducibility tracking
        
    - Notebook sharing and commenting
        
    - Automated experiment logging
        
    - Metrics tracking (accuracy, backtest performance, deployment readiness)
        
- **PM Challenges:** Ensuring adoption, motivating usage, integrating with existing workflows.
