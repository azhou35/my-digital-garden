i have a lot of brain fog today 

maybe i can do a writer's picnic in first week of May
i feel quite detached from my body and confused and upset and unwell 
i am looking for something that makes me feel larger than myself

do i want to go into graphic design? or some of design? 
i think i need to do something creative and visual to avoid going crazy and burning out
day 1 of finding my creative spark again

i need to find my creative spark by drawing

day 1 of rediscovering my love for art
day 1 of filling up my art journal 
im almost a year into my coroporate job
and i prob spend 80% staring at a computer
im starting a series to draw and do something creativ eevery day 

video ideas:
- make my japan travel journal 
- go on a central park photo walk 
- go cowork in a cafe with a friend today
- doodle at writing club today
- play with graphic design today 
- doodle people 
- doodle a menu with me 
- doodle on a photo with me
