### observations
- la is cooler/cloudier than i expect - the cloud consumes the sky
- passing by dump yards of trucks and trash cans and debris and cardboard boxes spilling onto the floor
- makes way for bulbous bushes 
- and dry grass 
- expanse of brown hills 
- distant powerlines 
- i adore the way the upcoming scene slides into my purview 
- people watching - people running within the grass in the distance, people getting off the train and walking up the stairs, ants climbing a mountain, multi layers or movement 
- trees aer so interesting here - verdant tendrils that spiral outward like hands 
- human life in third person pov 
- mini ponds 
- flattrees
- driving along a long river

### introspection
- i want to improve my "mece" thinking - aka, how do you create a framework / data model / ontology that encompasses the component of a problem, while being legible and understandable?
	- frequently people are confused by my tables and choices of labels 
	- struggled in peregrine's data model problem
