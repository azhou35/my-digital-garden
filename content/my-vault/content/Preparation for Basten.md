## Baseten Story "Why Baseten"
- came across thru it in several avenues
	- conviction 
	- research for contrary (on platforms for ai deployment)
	- truss on my own running business case on model deployment for ai workloads
- came up over and over again and what rlly drove conviction is reading one of the blog posts by samika about their experience 

Tell me about urself:
* eng high school, did a lot of curriculum development for kids
* magic and beauty of jupyter notebooks
* teaching people by helping them focus on the magic of development 
* started career at aws as a technical writer creating tutorials for machine learning using nlp apis 
* overall theme of democratizing access to the coolest technologies 
* come full circle as a technical pm at microsoft where i work w customers on their specific workloads
* been researching open sorce tools foe ml deploymenr
* see my sister, the smartest person i know, struggling to deploy machine learning models for her research experiments
* really identified the need to unblock ppl from the pains of ml serving & deployment so they can focus on what matters

# "Tell Me About Yourself" for Baseten (With Signposting)

"I'd like to share my journey through three key chapters that have led me to Baseten: my early passion for technology education, my professional experience with AI infrastructure, and my personal connection to the challenges of model deployment.

**First, my foundation in technology education.** I've always been drawn to making complex technology accessible to others. This journey began in high school where I developed curriculum to teach engineering concepts to kids. I discovered the magic of tools like Jupyter notebooks that allow people to focus on creating rather than getting bogged down in technical details.

**Moving to my professional experience,** this passion for democratizing technology led me to AWS, where I worked as a technical writer creating tutorials for machine learning and NLP APIs. I found fulfillment in helping developers navigate complex systems and unlock their potential.

My career evolved as I moved into product management, but the core mission remained the same. Currently, as a Technical PM at Microsoft Azure, I work directly with customers like OpenAI on their AI workloads, helping translate their technical needs into operational solutions. I've gained firsthand experience with the challenges of deploying and scaling AI infrastructure at an enterprise level.

**The third chapter, and what brings me here today,** is my personal connection to the problem Baseten is solving. What really crystallized my interest in model deployment was watching my sister—who's brilliant at ML research—struggle endlessly with deploying her models for experiments. Despite her expertise in building models, the deployment process created unnecessary friction that took time away from her actual research. This personal connection helped me identify a critical need: unblocking people from the pains of ML serving and deployment so they can focus on what truly matters.

**That brings me to why I'm interested in Baseten specifically.** I've been actively researching open-source tools for ML deployment, which led me to Baseten and Truss. I became convinced of the value after running my own business case analysis on model deployment solutions for AI workloads.

**To sum up why I'm excited about this Solutions Engineering role,** it directly aligns with what drives me: quickly iterating with customers to solve real problems and accelerate their time to market with LLMs. What compels me about Baseten comes down to three things: the personal connection I feel to the problem you're solving, my passion for this space, and the impressive team you've built. I see an opportunity to combine my analytical strengths and operational experience to drive meaningful outcomes for both the company and its customers."

### Why solutions engineering:



To me, any stage when im recruiting requires me think about my compulsion. What drives me? Find myself driven easiest when i am compelled to them inherently. Tandem presents a very natural confluence of these factors. I can break it down into these three
1. personal connection
2. passion for people  
3. ppl i met

When i think about it a first things pop out.
Startups - business ops 
With solutions engineering team i see an opportunity that can combine my communication strengths and prototyping experience with something i look forward to to driving outcoms for company.I also believe this role directly aligns with the value proposition of baseten: by quickly iterating with customers, I'm excited to directly accelerate time to market for teams who want to leverage LLMs.
1) First of all, while ive built a foundation in product management, I'm particularly drawn to solutions engineering  because it allows me to have a broader impact across the business. In my current role at Microsoft, I've found that I thrive most when I'm working on day to day business outcomes for our client, in this case openai. driving strategic business planning that translated technical AI requirements into operational resource allocation.
what I've realized is that I'm energized by the variety and scope that comes with S&O work.
i enjoy diving into multiple workstreams at once, that leverage you know left side right side of the brain. 
"I'm drawn to solutions engineering because it sits at the perfect intersection of my technical expertise, product experience, and passion for customer success.

2) Throughout my career, from AWS to Microsoft Azure, I've found myself most energized when I'm directly helping customers overcome technical challenges and realize value. At Microsoft, I particularly enjoyed conducting calls with genomics customers and coordinating across teams to translate research capabilities into practical workflows. This direct customer impact is what makes solutions engineering so appealing to me.

I also believe this role directly aligns with Baseten's value proposition. By quickly iterating with customers, I'd be directly accelerating time to market for teams who want to leverage LLMs. When I think about what drives me professionally, I find myself most motivated when I can see the tangible outcomes of my work - and solutions engineering provides that immediate feedback loop.

The role also perfectly balances technical depth with business acumen. I enjoy diving into multiple workstreams that leverage both analytical and creative thinking. For example, at Microsoft, I thrived when developing operational frameworks for our supercomputing infrastructure while also driving strategic business planning that translated technical AI requirements into resource allocation.

Watching my sister struggle with model deployment for her research showed me how critical these solutions are. I want to be the person who removes those roadblocks for customers, allowing them to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure challenges.

In solutions engineering, I see an opportunity to combine my product background, technical understanding of AI infrastructure, and passion for democratizing access to cutting-edge technology - all while having a direct impact on Baseten's success and growth."
