going along with my [[content/entropy - intro v2|entropy - intro v2]] idea, I want to consider how we can  . 

one-liner: mini civic stack for friend-communities 

[[jan-feb vibe coding ideas]]
1. [[library of the commons]]: ask everyone to bring a book to the book swap. ask them to submit to a form with 1) photo of book 2) title 3) brief (<1 sentence) description. have them swap with someone. then publish a "library catalog" of everyone's book, using arena input -> website
	1. use [[content/arena api|arena api]]
	2. **commentary**: 
		1. what is the social move: swap books / reveal taste / start convos
		2. what does reader do with the catalog later? 

2. heat map of emotional cartography: 
	1. gather user sentiment of google reviews
	2. collect data of people on the streets 
3. collaborative scrapbooking: for my birthday ask everyone to submit their favorite memories of me and them 
	1. as well as bring their favorite ephemera of sf 
	2. intimacy + consent + curation.
4. 
questions:
5. who is "we"?
	- my friends and their second degree connections
  6. Unit of contribution: what is the smallest thing someone submits?
  7. Affordance: what does the system make easier than “just texting it”?
  8. Output artifact: what persists and is browsable later?
  9. Feedback loop: what makes people return / respond / connect?
