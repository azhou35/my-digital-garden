Overall:
- end to end timing will be bound by repair velocity
decouple hardware from software

under the impression that The node by node level automation for CX7 would be ready, 
there's really 2 options here: updating nodes with cx7 as they come back to production. but it means that OAI ther would be an HCA mismatch between the clusters that have been taken into repair vs not taken repair. so OAI would either need to sign off on being ok with HCA mismatch, or we would need to hold back non updated clusters from their use. This is the recommendation from the CX7 team. 

If we did want to do it across all of PH11 at once, for example, we would need some support for the CX7 team for node recovery.
go to oai - we need 8 hour downtime window we want to take the full clusters phx11 - 27 
update hca first 
rameez is going to manual remediation 

pcie will be fixed and we should be done 

take gpc first
take gpc01 first

propose 1 week downtime for cluster



hca is critical
21st start gpc01 
remediation is done by raj and folks
going to take 3 days manual
2 days organically 

phx61 - shotgun did it all once 
if i have cx7 version a and b 
no error 
pcie retimers is not in the latest version 
if that update happens after cx7 is updaetd
cx7 
dont have timeline 

doing crd  

july 15 - hca gets updated
we ask phx 11 - only hca gets updated 


taking single gpc 01 and repairing 
fabric is all of them 
is any of them are out of the we risk degradation 
we dont do partial host channel 
Top level groouping PHX11
taking down PHX11, give us entire PHX11 andwe take that down 8 hour update on PCIE + 
Was a concern on whether Sequencing CRD of it matters


july 21 
this update 
We were planning to do the entire cluster at once 
This swoop of ppl diong the entire data at once 

Concentrated at once cluster 
Phsyical limitation is we're looking at it cluster by cluster 

they need all of hca down
on day 1 
this is what bare minimum needed
u can use these 4 clusters 


decouple our manual remediation 
do it on a custer by cluster basis 
renders the entire cluster unusabe 

july 21 focus on 

july 24

for oai 
- if u take entire cluster down
physica

HCA - 
- needs to be applied at the data center level 
- inconsistent versioning 
- they can use the ones that havent gotten the update

phx11gpc01
- that will get the hca cx7 

as the baseboards are coming into ofr

u can take that entire capacity
bc u entire 

when they go back into production that are firmware
