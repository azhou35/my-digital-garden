title: "early july startup thoughts"
---

- generally looking to recruit in series b - d 
- for product / customer deployment roles
- lots of self reflection
- going thru w a scale ai tpm role before the news broke and decided to not go with 
	- lots of latent momentum thats stopped short 
	- dove into these ai data labeling companies 
		- e.g. mercor 
- general takeaway is ai infra rlly is concentrated in sf, but nyc is for the app layers
	- someone had the great take that for product at a place like harvey, trust is the product 

framework for what im looking for 
- what is high growth and has a lot of potential up for the taking? 


connections made:
- soma capital - irene koo / aneel / nikhita 
- primary - tom 
- convos w ai infra ppl
	- baseten - gpu inference deployment 
	- etched - chips that burn the transformer on chip
two buckets - 
- pure ai infra 
- app layer applications of ai 
	- fintech - rogo, ramp, etc
	- healthcae
- nikhita 
	- semiconductors datacenters
openrouter ai 

general interesting areas:
- supercomputing problems 
	- observability across the fleet
		- mismatch between hardware and software signals
		- aka things break before we get into it 
		- ai infra - managing gpu ops is less about hardware and more bout orchestration between physical and software visibility
- voice ai - voice memo app
	- ideal flow seems to be, speech to text 
- thinking about the disconnect between research and engineering
values:
- intelligence / sharpness
- willingness to care
- investing in ppl > ideas
	- what i found interesting is when i asked about how primary would deem factor fellowship a success
	- bc what ive seen about startup recruiting cycle is that itsj just so unpredictable
