Are AI Datacenters indicative of the next wave Industrial Revolution in terms of job creation and economic growth? 

Can AI datacenters bring back the industrial town - and what does mean for the people inside them?
Historically the growth of American cities was propped up by large construction projects (e.g. steel mining in PGH, etc) before we shifted to a services-based economy. 
DC companies strike Faustian deals with local communities, promising job inflow and lucrative tax benefits.
I'd like to do a long-form article via case studies on various communities and their datacenters as (CW revitalizing a retired crypto center in Denton) and include interviews with the workers on the ground. The invisible labor is mundane and toilsome, involving lots of standing around and wiring racks. 

There's a lot of noise on DCs - as well as a particularly well-written article in the New Yorker here https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/11/03/inside-the-data-centers-that-train-ai-and-drain-the-electrical-grid - and I believe the public is missing a profile written from an industry SME. 

when was the last time this much labor was displaced

Diffuse AI is going to help answer all these questions, in as much nitty gritty qualitative detail as possible. We want:

- In-depth case studies of how AI is playing out in your industry — the more specific, the better.
- Interviews with experts about what current models are and aren’t useful for in their work.
- Stories of similar instances of historical tech diffusion.
- Thoughtful discussions of the strengths, weaknesses, and methodologies of economic impact benchmarks like [GDPeval](https://openai.com/index/gdpval/) or the [Anthropic Economic Index](https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index).
    

We don’t want:

- Predicting the future.
    
- Theorizing from first principles.
    
- Coming with an axe to grind.
