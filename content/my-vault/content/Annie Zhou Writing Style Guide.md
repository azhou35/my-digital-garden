## Purpose

This vault is a place to develop ideas that compound.

Each note should stand on its own and also connect cleanly to others. The goal is not raw journaling. The goal is to write crisp thoughts that can later be assembled into something larger without heavy rewriting.

Think in blocks, not streams.

## Core Principles
Write so ideas can stack.
Treat notes as building material.
A future essay should feel like arranging already-solid pieces, not excavating buried thoughts.

## What to Avoid

Avoid vague insight statements.
If an idea cannot be pointed to or tested against reality, sharpen it or cut it.

Avoid AI filler and essay scaffolding.
No “in this piece,” “we explore,” or “this suggests.”

Avoid rhetorical questions.
State the tension instead of asking it.

Avoid dashes and decorative punctuation.

## Building Toward a Piece

Write as if this note could become a paragraph later.
