Sora feedback from fal.ai a $10M+ ARR imagegen and Sora customer that aggregates models (OSS and proprietary) and makes them available to millions of developers and enterprises. They are valued at $4.5B and are backed by A16Z, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, and Nvidia.

Sora areas for improvementSora content moderation is much stricter: Requests to Sora hit content moderation filters 40-50% of the time, vs. 3% for Google and 2% for KlingExample: Sora will block image-to-video for a fight scene due to “violence” which prevents using Sora for action scenesLatency: imagegen-1.5 is slower than nano banana - 25-55 seconds vs. 20 secondsCharacter consistency: Sora character consistency has room for improvement relative to Nano Banana and QwenFeedback on upcoming Cameos: Interesting, but only if stateless (i.e., likeness can be sent with request vs. be pre-approved with a multi-step flow)“Creative Engineering” report: Fal has a significant “Creative Engineering” team that constantly tests different models and generates reports that show relative performance across models - they said they can share a version of this with OpenAI so I will circle back with that when I have it.
