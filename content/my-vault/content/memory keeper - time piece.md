[[time piece]]

short story about clocks, watches, aging, heartbreak, and growing up and being afraid of my parents aging
*i want to let this short story brief outside of the time constraints of a bi-weekly substack article.*

i think the common thread amongst my ex'es is a fervent passion for *something,* especially, something that wasn't me. the vice of choice for the one in college was watches. 

friday morning i intended to return a stained jacket at garage, but my mind kept returning to the vision of a vintage gold watch. walking six minutes from the canal station i avoided the tourists flooding chinatown at the first prospect of warmth, routing to mike's watches.

it takes me a few minutes to clamor together the clumsy chinese, saying something along the lines of: "zhi liang ge shou biao, wo yao yi zai zhong jian." his immediate english response cuts me off -- don't worry, i can adjust whatever. which one? both? 

cheeks flushed & i shake my head wordlessly, and resume to staring at the mirror for an eternal decision on which one i thought would fit my wrist better. i tried to rack my head for what the man from *watches of switzerland* had said all those years ago -- the watch face should be halfway the size of the wrist? no, a third? 

he goes back to speaking *cantonese* to the locals who have pulled up. my gall to communicate has escaped me, but i extend my hand and allow him to fasten a watch onto my wrist. it's a beautiful thing, golden framed bezel and faux diamonds glittering in the store light.

there are certain moments when your perception of time shifts. when you graduate school, when you fall in love, when you have children. 

in the break of summer heat, i feel restless. time feels slippery, an elusive thing that is constantly escaping my grasp. like some koi fish i struggle upstream against water that's going downwards. i am restless, trying to speedwalk my way into chinatown, constantly bumping into traffic jams behind the slow-moving grandmas dragging suitcases across the jagged streets.

signs of age worry me. maybe because it's a harsh reminder of how differently time unfolds for my parents versus me - i am at the start of my career while theirs winds down. time dilates based on our gravitational pull to the world - in this strong gravitational field the currents pull me in and out. 

on tuesday my parents crash i watch my parents and they feel like kids in my eyes. 

observe the back of a watch and lay privy to the excellence of its back. the labriynthe network of 

there's an omega watch my mom keeps in her jewelry box that lies neglected. she has no intention to use it other than to pass it down to me.

in a society that is racing forward is it not ironic how our time machines are stuck in the past?
