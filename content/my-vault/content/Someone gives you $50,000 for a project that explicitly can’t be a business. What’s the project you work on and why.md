positive feedback from the ppl i associate w 
what would the video be about idk


film making is the most multi-sensory form of creative expression i believe in. 

whats & why
* why: film making is a way of story telling that im drawn towards
* maybe a documentary ? investment in good camera,s travel, all to tell a story
* something tracig the immigrant journey?
	* i think i would make a film about chinatown
	* how its evolved during and post pandemic
	* im deeply moved by stories, and this neighborhood overwhelms with them 
	* a way of highlighting the local aunties and uncles
* i grew up going to chinatown from nj 
* now i live right by 
* ive seeen them through all stages of the pandemic 
* some desire to uplift their voices and create a cinematic world
or make a cinematic film about meaning making / finding community / adult lonelinesss?
* drawn by sci fi stories
* inspired by her -- lots of thoughts on technology and how it stands against our dsire for community adn compansionship
	* updated post 2024 
* i want to remake her and imagine the future 
* i like scifi short stories 
* make scifi short stories 
* Like science fiction writer Ted Chiang said in an interview with journalist Ezra Klein, “Most of our fears or anxieties about technology are best understood as fears or anxiety about how capitalism will use technology against us.” The challenge, then, is how to disentangle the two.
* Sci-fi doesn’t just imagine the future—it imagines human nature. We need to take that responsibility seriously.

I grew up reading about robots, automated intimacy, 

film projects
* a film about growing up in nj as a asian american and assimilating
* a film 
* something about urban development 
* punchy - videos -

* i like going into rabbit holes about (what???)
* something like "everything and anywhere"
* something on adult loneliness
__ something cinematic universe
- the goal is to make us feel a little less lonely and also take a critical glance at how we use technology
