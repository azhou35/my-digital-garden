complex domains have rich relational structure -> relational grah -> modeling relationships achieve better performance
challenges: networks are complex w arbitrary size and complex topological, no fixed node ordering or reference point, dynamic w multimodal features
choice between grahs - directed vs undirected, bipatite graph,
