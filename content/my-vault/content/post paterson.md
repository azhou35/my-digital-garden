title: "post paterson"

let life dictate the art
art in response to the art
![[Pasted image 20240711212126.png]]
paterson doesnt write for recognition, just for yourself
criticism on being famous wihtout the craft
content for one self

paterson is slow moving
normality in events that place
he creates the poems for himself
