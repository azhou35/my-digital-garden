centered on nova and londoun center data center alley 

a piece for a technologist to understand data centers as a piece of manufacturing 
human consequences of technical systems

i want to talk about how it reshaeps humans
 - the workers
 - rural community identity changes
 - datancenters becoming symbols of power or anxiety
dc developmnt and paranoia / safety
type of jobs it produces:
- data center electricians
- hvac technicians
- drywall professionals 

the ai factory. 
(what is an example of a factory that matches ai?)
technicians working past burnout


in denton the local news paints a rosy story about the economic output this project promises to bring. like most things, reddit exposes the true sentiment. https://dentonrc.com/news/denton/denton-data-center-is-shifting-focus-to-ai-planning-to-grow-and-use-more-power/article_567f9da6-a766-11ef-b426-f30ec039dfa7.html 

denton benefitted from infrastructure investments - a railroad line in 1881 and the dallas/forth worth airport in 1974.

### inside the thinking machine
what is ok to give up in a community/society? 

it's the classic tyranny of the commons, an economic question - a factory that will be built in a town promises economic output but brings with it irreversible environmental impact. 

**what happens to the humans inside of the ai factory**

twitter has done overtime to lionize the software class atop ai, with little spotlight on the humans with the boots on the ground. 
working as a datacenter technician is rare form of work that is active, technical, and surprisingly technical. 
hardware operators lift 30-50 pound equipment to install and rack servers, replace failed components. you stand 8-10 hours per shift, and walk for up to 5-7 miles up the large datacenter.
a segment of the work is just emergency response - with critical slas to meet all hands are on deck if a switch fails. 
people come in from all over, tech backgrounds, ex military, general construction work. 

there's high demand, for all the kids crashing out about the post-pandemic cs market. situated in rural areas, these markets simply lack the people. 

“The greatest pipeline we have are former military service members. They have so many transferable skills. They are used to working in very programmatic structures. Navy nuclear operators are the most-sought-after veterans.” 

the nature of the work lends to it. with complicated but repetitive procedures, high-stakes alarms, and highly embodied labor.

there are fatigue related stress. 

it's paradoxical, to have high responsibility but low status.

**what happens to the humans around the ai factory**
"We always considered those things a liability,” he said.“We thought they depressed the value of the land.”But now, he
said, access to a power substation was worth a fortune—one of his neighbors claimed that he had sold a plot of farmland to a data-center developer for more than a million dollars an acre, more than the farm would return in a lifetime. Piece
by piece, the farmer said, his family was doing the same."

property values and land use:
* data centers dont create housing or retail opportunities - create dead zones
* zoning boards overwhelmed
* farmland spikes 
example:
- loudoun county - daa center alley
- has become a sprawling, humming bunker 
- it brings:
	- jobs, money, tax revenue 
	- carbon footprint
	- highest median household income 
	- In 2022, data centers paid $640 million in taxes to the Commonwealth and $1 billion to local governments in Virginia, with fewer service needs than other industries. In Loudoun County, data centers paid approximately $26 for every dollar of local public services they required. Benefit-to-cost ratios for other businesses rarely exceed a four to one ratio.
	- The county’s public schools are ranked as the fourth best in the state and boast an ultra-competitive STEM magnet school and a ninety-seven percent overall graduation rate
job creation reality:
* fewer jobs than industrial development - unlike manufactuing facilitiates that created whole comunities
energy grid effects - small businesses and housing developments waitlisted for power
dead zone
* 2023 - Dominion Energy announced they couldnt connect any new data centers 


at my old job at microsoft i would coordinate maintenances with some of these data center technicians. 

this world always felt abstract to me - numbers on a spreadsheet, distilled into outrageous funding announcements. i was detached from the maintenance work - in one instance where i orchestrated a power sequence i had to work with the technicians on the exact point of record of the steps. what would happen to the callans, to the transformers, to the gpu nodes when we power them down?  my colleagues at the time felt extremely distant from me, much like most of my peers in a company of 228,000 folks. there was a slight southern twang to their voice, and at times their words would be muffled by static as they called from the floor. 

in the haze of the desert, the building emerges almost a a mirage, a blip, an alien-placed item in the middle of otherwise peace. 

i wear steel toed boots, which i ordered last week from amazon. 

in urban areas, symbols of power extend vertically into the sky. in rural areas, they expand horizontally into the edges of your vision. 

**what happens to human meaning**
texas is a natural choice for data centers. its power generation capacity (thanks to an independent grid ERCOT) leads to a deregulated power market and generally low electricity prices. 

the problem here is resilience:
- weather proofing is poor
- grid is intentionally isolated
and its not used to sudden spikes in weather, let along the rapid disruptions to its power grid. 


factories displaced human labor in the past. 

these ai factories do that and then some. it displaces human purpose. 

the smallest unit of a gpu is a node. many nodes make up a gpu, which make up a rack, which makes up a row, of which many make a colo in a datacenter and finally the entire campus. what is mind boggling is that training runs can sometimes cross multiple datacenters, implying that a singular building is still considered a singular unit. 

the town itself has become a neural node in a global brain.
