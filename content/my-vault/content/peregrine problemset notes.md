- pattern of money laundering
- consider
	- transaction size, transaction frequency, commonly used send and pay agents, send and pay locations, and so on
- list hypotheses of what indicates a suspicious transaction
	- e.g.: 
	- short time between the wiring and receiving of a transaction may be suspicious because the quick reception of a transfer means that the receiver was informed that the transaction would be coming through

## List of Hypothesis
1. Structuring/smurfing
	1. Pattern: multiple transactions under reportable thresholds sent in frequent time intervals to the same sender
	2. Pattern: Same agent sending several transactions over a short time (like within 1 day/1 hr)
2. Anomalous Age Differentials
	1. Hypothesis: A very young or old agent sending to someone on the opposite end of the age spectrum (such as a 15 year old sending money to a 80 year old)
	2. Age > 75 or < 20 making high value transactions
	3. elder abuse
3. Same Sender sending to Multiple Recipients in Different States
	1. Hypothesis:
4. Unusual Send/Receive Country Pairings
	1. Transaction to high-risk countries flagged by FATF or FinCEN (US/Panama)
5. Same Sender -> Multiple Recipients in Diff States
6. Same Payee Receiving Money from many different senders
	1. More than 5 unique senders -> same payee 
7. customers with accounts w several institutions within the same locality
8. people where sender sends more than 5 transactions to the same person in a day
