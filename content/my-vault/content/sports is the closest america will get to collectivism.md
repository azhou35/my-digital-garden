hockey!
		- lots of thoughts about sports again
		- i think it's a really elegant sport when they move
			- less so when they try to act
				- bc the hockey is an extension of self and its not a fully controllable limb 
			- itd be so cool to do like an animation representing hockey players on the rink bc they are constantly moving around a central midpoint
			- they dont score as much here
			- the puck kinda goes crazy, less precise
			- not as violent as i thought it would be (aka cornell)
		- the word of the day is zamboni
		- there's a spectrum on how easy a sport is to watch with little context of the sport
			- e.g. baseball is on the max: hard to watch w o context
				- its like reading a calculus book without arithmetic
			- hockey is relatively easy to watch
				- u shoot puck into goal
			- basketball has some nuance and elegance
			- football surprisingly so
		- im circulating a lot of thoughts around sports, should write about it some time
