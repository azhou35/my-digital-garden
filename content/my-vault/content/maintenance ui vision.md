# Product Requirements Document: Maintenance Management UI (MVP)

## Problem Statement
Maintenance tooling today is optimized for infrastructure, not people.
Operators are forced to reason across logs, scripts, provider dashboards, and chat threads to answer basic questions:
* *What is currently under maintenance?*
* *Who owns it?*
* *Is it safe to end?*
* *Why is this node still unavailable?*
The lack of a clear, human-centered interface increases operational risk, slows recovery, and leads to maintenance events that never properly close.

---

## Goal
Build a **maintenance-first user interface** that allows operators to:
* Understand maintenance state at a glance
* Safely initiate and confirm maintenance actions
* Monitor health during and after maintenance
* Explicitly close or extend maintenance with confidence
* Communicate status clearly to stakeholders

The UI is backed by a single source of truth, but the **primary product surface is the interface**.

---

## Target Users

* Technical Program Managers
* Site Reliability Engineers
* Infrastructure Operations Leads
* On-call responders (read-only)

---

## Core UI Surfaces (MVP)

### 1. Maintenance Overview Page

**Purpose:** Answer “what is happening right now?”

**UI Elements**

* Table or card list of active maintenance events
* Each row shows:

  * Maintenance ID
  * Provider / environment
  * Number of affected nodes
  * Start time → End time
  * Status (Active / Ending Soon / Extended)
  * Owner
* Filters:

  * Environment / provider
  * Status
  * Cluster / region
* Visual warnings:

  * Approaching end date
  * Unhealthy nodes detected

**Primary Actions**

* View maintenance details
* Create new maintenance

---

### 2. Maintenance Creation Flow

**Purpose:** Safely turn intent into an explicit maintenance event.

**Step 1: Define Scope**

* Input fields:

  * Node identifiers (hardware ID, VM ID, hostname, etc.)
  * Provider / environment
  * Maintenance type
* Flexible input: operators can paste identifiers in bulk

**Step 2: System Resolution**

* UI resolves inputs into a **preview list of affected nodes**
* Shows:

  * Total nodes affected
  * Environment breakdown
  * Any unresolved or ambiguous inputs

**Step 3: Confirmation**

* Operator must confirm:

  * This is the correct node set
  * Start time
  * End time (required)
* Clear warning:

  > “Nodes will remain unavailable until this maintenance is explicitly ended or expires.”

**Submit**

* Maintenance event is written to the system of record
* Execution begins automatically

---

### 3. Maintenance Detail Page

**Purpose:** Provide a single pane of glass for one maintenance event.

**UI Sections**

* Header:

  * Maintenance ID
  * Owner
  * Status
  * Start / End time
* Node list:

  * Per-node status (in maintenance, healthy, unhealthy)
  * Current health signal
  * Last updated timestamp
* Communication links:

  * Slack / email / ticket references
* Audit trail:

  * Who created, modified, extended, or ended maintenance

**Primary Actions**

* End maintenance
* End maintenance for healthy nodes only
* Extend maintenance for selected nodes

---

### 4. Maintenance End & Recovery UX

**Purpose:** Prevent nodes from getting stuck in maintenance.

**When End Time Is Reached**

* Healthy nodes:

  * Automatically released
* Unhealthy nodes:

  * Highlighted prominently
  * Maintenance auto-extended
  * Owner notified

**Operator Options**

* Extend maintenance (with new end date)
* End maintenance for recovered nodes
* Copy autogenerated recovery message for stakeholders:

  > “Maintenance completed for X nodes. Y nodes remain unavailable due to failed recovery.”

---

### 5. Node Maintenance Status View

**Purpose:** Answer “why is this node unavailable?”

* Dedicated view showing:

  * Current maintenance state
  * Associated maintenance ID
  * Owner
  * Expected end time
* Read-only for most users
* Linked directly from cluster / node views
## Non-Goals (MVP)

* Fully autonomous maintenance decisions
* Complex capacity or scheduling optimization
* Provider-specific UI customizations
* Deep workflow automation without human confirmation

---

## Success Metrics

* Operators can answer “what’s under maintenance?” in <30 seconds
* No maintenance events remain open unintentionally
* Reduced on-call involvement for routine maintenance
* Fewer recovery errors due to unclear ownership or status

---

## Future Enhancements

* Natural-language maintenance creation (“Describe what you want to maintain”)
* Calendar-based scheduling view
* SLA indicators and breach warnings
* Workload-level and user-impact overlays
* Deeper integration with incident management tooling

---

## Summary

This product treats **maintenance as a first-class UX problem**, not just an infrastructure concern. By centering the interface around operator understanding and explicit decision-making, it reduces risk, improves recovery, and scales safely across heterogeneous environments.
