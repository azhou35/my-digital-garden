title: "Female-led vibe coding apps"

Girls getting into vibe coding is a massively underrated upside.

Developer and product roles are still dominated by men.(ofc there’s bunch of good developers that’s women) If we turn vibe coding into a creative medium and give more girls a lower bar way to build apps, we’ll start to see a lot of features that don’t come from a male mental model, and even entirely new markets around women’s unmet needs.

Not to mention the advantage women already have on aesthetics.

I’ve seen a few vibe-coded apps where the only goal is “make it look beautiful.” It might be a weather app, it might be a notes app, the exact function doesn’t matter, everyone’s optimizing for something different.
