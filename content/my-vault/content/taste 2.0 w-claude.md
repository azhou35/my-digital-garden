# on taste: the art of discernment in an age of abundance

> "tell me what you eat and i will tell you who you are" — brillat-savarin

my winter break ritual involved daily episodes of "culinary class wars" with my sister, a korean cooking show where chefs from different backgrounds compete for dominance. the premise is deliciously symbolic: "white spoons" (representing culinary elites) battle against "black spoons" (chefs from humble origins). in korean culture, being "born with a silver spoon" signifies privilege—this show makes that metaphor literal.

two judges with contrasting perspectives oversee the competition: paik jong-won champions accessible, universally appealing food that could introduce korean cuisine to the masses, while anh sung-jae, from his three-michelin-star perch, scrutinizes every detail with exacting standards.

this culinary theater reveals something profound about taste itself. to discern isn't merely to distinguish good from bad—it's to differentiate good from great.
## the social currency of taste

in new york, after exchanging instagram handles, people inevitably ask for your beli (and maybe your number if they're feeling cheeky). we've developed specialized apps for every consumption category: letterboxd for films, goodreads for literature, beli for restaurants. if instagram projects who you want others to think you are, these external platforms lend credibility to your claims of discernment.

as someone once observed: "when people talk about taste and how to acquire it, i often feel they're groping for a shortcut to access their own interiority. most think about desirability in terms of what _others_ are doing—_this is the hottest coat of the season; this artist has blown up and now they're too mainstream; i need a birkin because hermès makes them difficult to purchase_. i keep seeing brands sell things by aping caroline bessette-kennedy's style, her 'aesthetic,' when she herself was a perfectionist who bought relatively few clothes. self-possession sells, but you can't buy it."

this creates an interesting paradox: taste is inherently subjective, yet we collectively acknowledge certain rankings as authoritative. my friend and i can debate our favorite thai restaurants, comparing khao soi preparations before concluding with the comfortable truce that "taste is subjective."

but according to hume, this response isn't satisfying. he views taste as fundamental to our capacity for moral and aesthetic judgment. certain works—anna karenina, the mona lisa—maintain their status as timelessly tasteful. there's something beyond mere preference at work.

## the architecture of discernment

painter john foley offers perhaps the most elegant definition of taste i've encountered: "'good taste' is simply to have a well formed opinion, in accordance with the realities of the good and the true."

as another writer notes, "though taste may appear effortless, you can't have it by mistake. it requires intention, focus, and care. taste is a commitment to a state of attention. it's a process of peeling back layer after layer, turning over rock after rock."

true arbiters of taste—whether judging food, wine, coffee, or art—operate from robust frameworks. developing such a framework requires:

1. **strong sense** (presence and attention)
2. **delicate sentiment** (sensitivity to nuance)
3. **sustained practice** (dedicated exposure)
4. **comparison** (contextual understanding)
5. **freedom from prejudice** (openness to experience)

consider a food critic: they possess heightened sensory perception, catch subtle flavor variations, regularly experience diverse cuisines, compare dishes across contexts, and strive to evaluate without being swayed by nostalgia, novelty, or gimmicks.

over an $8 sushi roll, a friend once quoted "jiro dreams of sushi" to me: "without good taste, you can't make good food. if your sense of taste is lower than that of the customers, how will you impress them?"

this encapsulates the principle perfectly: you are what you eat. _dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es_. consuming quality shapes your own intuition and output.

this explains the distinction between a new york times food critic and a foodie influencer, a literary critic versus a goodreads reviewer. the former might seem pretentious or nitpicky, but they're operating from a carefully developed framework rather than momentary impressions.

what interests me isn't your beli ranking but the thinking process behind it—not what you like, but how you arrived there.

## taste as point of view

chef anh, despite his elite background, approves dishes across the spectrum—from molecular gastronomy creations to humble school cafeteria fare. his consistent evaluation framework allows any dish to impress him, regardless of ingredient cost.

his golden rule? dishes should have a clear point of view. if something is presented as fine dining, he evaluates the precision of each knife cut; if it's comfort food for tired office workers, he focuses on flavor and satisfaction. the chef's responsibility is to assert a perspective through their creation, and the consumer's role is to engage with that intention.

art should embody a point of view. being intentional about what you consume and articulate about why certain qualities attract you—this is the essence of taste.

we contain an interiority that both shapes and is shaped by what we consume. by cultivating taste, we develop a personal lens through which we perceive the world. taste reveals what we pay attention to, and attention is a proxy for what we truly value.

## digital diet in an algorithmic age

i sometimes feel like a lost "black spoon" chef—unknown and seeking validation, dropped into a buffet of algorithmic excess, a whirlwind of internet rabbit-holes and rapid-fire content competing for my limited attention. how do i choose what to consume?

in an era of algorithmic recommendations and infinite content, developing authentic taste becomes both more crucial and more challenging. kyle chayka argues that algorithms flatten our culture, breeding monoculture as micro-trends in fashion, art, and journalism bubble up through popularity-driven metrics. when seeking inspiration, don't just scroll through pinterest—observe the actual people around you.

the taste we develop through consumption ultimately feeds into what we create. just as a skilled chef prepares dishes uniquely their own, i want to infuse this individualism into my writing, photography, and technical work.

## intentionality: the heart of authentic taste

on "culinary class wars," a revealing moment occurred when a young chef served galbi with guacamole to appeal to chef anh's korean-californian background. anh immediately dismissed it as "fusion for fusion's sake"—evidence that the contestant hadn't yet developed a clear culinary point of view.

this moment illustrates a crucial aspect of taste: intentionality matters more than novelty or trendiness. whether in food, art, or digital content, authentic taste emerges from deliberate choices that reflect a coherent perspective rather than arbitrary combinations or attempts to please everyone.

i've come to believe that "taste honors someone's standards of quality, but also the distinctive way the world bounces off a person. it reflects what they know about how the world works, and also what they're working with in their inner worlds. when we recognize true taste, we are recognizing that alchemic combination of skill and soul. this is why it is so alluring."

in our algorithm-driven world where content is engineered for engagement rather than meaning, developing intentional taste becomes an act of resistance. it requires asking not just "do i like this?" but "why do i like this?" and "what does my preference reveal about my values?"

authentic taste isn't about having the "right" preferences—it's about having intentional ones that genuinely reflect who you are. the question isn't whether something is objectively good or bad, but whether it expresses a clear intention and whether that intention resonates with something true within you.

in developing taste, we aren't just curating our experiences—we're crafting our identity.
