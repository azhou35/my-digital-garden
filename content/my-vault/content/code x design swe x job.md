I'm a designer who thinks in code.

That's a roundabout way of saying that I am fascinated by projects that allow me to access both my technical skills and design prowess in tandem. As a writer, stories are sacred to me— I seek to find the heart of every product I build: _who will use it? What do they want? How will their experience change because of my work?_ These are the questions I am after. I suppose it's no surprise, then, that I was drawn to the world of UX engineering.

I graduated cum laude from the University of Washington with a B.S in Informatics, and a concentration in Data Science in June of 2023. My studies were largely focused on leveraging data science principles to impact human's lives. Outside of class, I pursued passion projects from satellite engineering to community based design. The intersection of people and technology is one that I am dedicated to studying throughout my life.
