title: "hegel on human will and freedom"
---

"- Hegel believed the will is inherently free, but its freedom is expressed through reason and self-consciousness. It's not just about making choices, but about understanding the reasons behind those choices and aligning them with a rational, universal purpose. "
"
Hegel distinguished between abstract freedom (the subjective will's capacity for choice) and concrete freedom (the rational will's self-determination within a social and ethical framework).

freedom is not simply the absence of external constraints, but the ability to act in accordance with reason and universal principles. This means that true freedom requires individuals to develop their rational capacities and understand their place within the larger social and historical context.

Instead, he thinks the will makes _rational_ choices, which is going to greatly limit its options. So far this is partially just a rehashing of the difference between randomness and free will.
