### Monthly Review
This month I prioritized 1) career 2) writing and 3) branding.
As a result, I had to deprioritize A) running/gym B) going into office C) photography D) cooking.

***In terms of career:*** 
I've cold-emailed around 20-30 people across product, operations, recruitment, and founding teams. 
I've succeeded in scheduling 10 exploratory calls. 
Three of my efforts were for Tandem, which was quick to move me through the strategy & ops pipeline, but my failures to pass (or even summon the will to prep) the first case round elucidated how important *form-context fit* is for my next role. I need to a) find a role that's as close to product management as possible (S&O won't cut it -- it's too close to consulting) b) find a problem space I'm intellectually passionate about (prior authorization also not a fit - i can't even figure out my own health insurance) and c) find a company at the right stage (tandem probably could have fit this but again, probably too early for me). In a way I'm a bit turned off when the company is TOO young - it's important to find somewhere with a path to product mentorship, and that requires co-workers / leaders who have done product before. 

***In terms of writing:*** 
In some part spurred by making writing club a thing & helping Cartesia out with its narration feature, I've committed to writing weekly on Substack. 

Super rewarding to follow up on my birthday cafe with a writing event and fold in some of my situational friends (co-workers) into my hobbies. By nature of my friends I'm trying to target thoughtful girlies (or guys!) who are great conversationalists, open-minded, and first-and-foremost warm. The actual passion for writing comes second; I think even someone who journals would enjoy the writing club. 

Speaking about my writing and speaking about Substack is inextricable. But while this platform has given me the confidence to consider writing as a hobby & practice, it's becoming clearer that Substack is not the end state. It favors short snappy pieces on universal feelings (love/friendship/intimacy) and less so on deep dives into my own intellectual curiosities -- at least in the niche I'm in. There are goals I have for my writing that I believe swell beyond the constraints of a newsletter: cultural anecdotes reminiscent of lit mags, deep dives into rabbitholes on infrastructure/urbanism, interactive websites for "scrollytelling." My hesitation is that all of these ideas require a concerted writing effort with a feedback loop way longer than Substack, and I'm stuck in a cycle of waiting to get enough conviction to full-send a project <> getting distracted by smaller writing stints. 

My efforts to submit to more-established publications are half-baked. I submitted an application to Works In Progress and unsurprisingly hadn't heard anything back, but I'm proud of myself for the audacity to try. I tried to push for a story on Lai Rai & cultural wine bars for off-menu mag, but the burden of coordination fell on me and chasing an unresponsive IG account, so I didn't make the mag's end of March deadline. 

***In terms of branding:***
This theme has come up many times, both in convos with [Justin]([1,000 True Fans? Try 100 | Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/)) as well as my personal spare cycles for the events I host. Let me delineate between my personal & community branding efforts.

It's no secret I'm an externalizer and Internet-native, but I've never quite cracked down creating an intentional persona on the interwebs. Authenticity is a core value, and parasocialism & social panopticism & performance freak me out. At the same time, there's only positive returns from establishing some sort of brand or story or throughline that ties all your disparate internet identities together. I write, I take photos, I like to talk to interesting people and gather them together, I'm interested in AI and its future, I like rabbit holes and the cultural layer atop the Internet -- but *who is Annie*? 

To try and answer this question is setting myself up for dissatisfaction, so instead, let me address what I've been doing to brand *Annie*. I posted more on Twitter in the week of March, aware that I need to warm up my timeline before I tweet something about Cartesia. I spent a fair amount of time on Figma [creating]([annie z 🍳 on X: "what is nostalgia but a false memory? inspired by a recent trip to flushing with my family, i followed our footsteps backward—from suburban new jersey to flushing food courts to a shanghai that's moved on without us. (1/5) https://t.co/fA24nsmEdk" / X](https://x.com/AnnieZhou13/status/1899529293161546022)) visuals for my Substack post on Flushing Food Courts, chalking up the effort as reps for a future cultural zine project -- it did ok. My tweet about Cartesia's Narration Feature did get impressions because I piggybacked off of their brand & launch -- but I question how much impact this sort of beta user / customer story has on both Cartesia's launch success & my own branding. Was this just a one-off experiment? 

I've been a bit more successful on Substack: posting regularly on Notes with some hits getting 40 - 200 likes. Nothing has really translated to remarkable growth on my actual writing, however; even when I try to write towards what is popular & poetic, the algorithm doesn't really pick up my writing and I rely on the support of my personal network.

I hosted two main events: my birthday cafe and a writing club. Both were highly intentional, high-effort in terms of branding, and quite successful (in terms of personal fulfillment & perceived group impact). My birthday cafe was a sprint to bring my vision to life -- I made Pinterest boards, a detailed plan of to-dos, stickers, logos, menus, as well as asking for participation from my friends. Also so so so much matcha. I think the only thing I regret is not being able to control its documentation -- I so wish I could exist in 3rd POV and take photos as well, or create a lil IG reel, or even remember to take photos of myself with the matcha. But that's the tradeoff between event host / event attendee / event documenter and a tension to explore another day. 

For writing club, I also came up with a core motif (wayward writers / intended to sound like way WORD writers / intended to evoke the idea of following your curiosities and going on a "random walk"). I made an IG & Justin suggested a newsletter dedicated to it. I want to spin this into something more, maybe a testbed of passionate individuals who would be inclined to go on a writing retreat / submit to a "club" zine / join a self-organized "camp" class in the summer.

### Takeaways
I am quite satisfied with my March - in part my birthday & anniversary at work gave me an additional sprint of energy to commit to exploring opportunities for jobs & locking into writing. There was a weekend where I overwhelmed myself with social activities, and I tried to course correct by not proactively planning hangs in the following couple of weeks and only accepting in-bound. While I had more space to breathe in those weekends, I gave up control over the types of activities I did - so had fewer photo walks, runs, cafe hangs, etc. I am happy I cut out going to random internet events (aside from a couple Verci ones). In a way I do want to go out more but I just wonder if I'm not that type of person. 

Looking forward to April, I want to reprioritize fitness as I have a half-marathon I've avoided thinking about. Now that I've collected a healthy number of datapoints on startups, I want to focus on reaching out to opportunities that truly fit my profile & interests; there is no pressure to jump ship & compromise. I want to choose one dedicated writing project to hone on, whether it's a research piece or a short story or another cultural reflection for the zine. I also want to cook + bake more; I've had some excellent meals this March thanks to my friends but I also miss making creative recipes.
