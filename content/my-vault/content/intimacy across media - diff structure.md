title: "intimacy across media - diff structure"
---

as a kid i loved my friends' birthday parties - not for the festivities but for a chance to crack open my scrapbooking kit and craft them a homemade card. there was something magical about transforming blank paper, how my chicken scratch handwriting and doodled bunnies in party hats become tokens of affection.

in 2025, our tools for connection have evolved dramatically, yet i still find myself drawn to the physicality of those handmade cards. this tension fascinates me: as our digital communication becomes increasingly sophisticated, our desire for tangible, imperfect human traces seems to grow stronger. what is it about handwritten notes that digital messages - despite their convenience and precision - cannot replace?

when making cards, i became intensely aware of the permanence of muji ink pen. each sentence taking up physical space, impossible to delete once written. my effort became visible, embedded in every fold and stroke.

digital communication can be just as thoughtful—i've spent hours crafting the perfect text—but this labor remains invisible to the recipient. no matter how long i agonize over a message, it arrives looking identical to a careless one. 

in a corner of my childhood room is a worn-out box containing all these letters -- a flurry of birthday wishes, hand-made cards, and crumpled up notes from high school lovers -- as well as the scraps of my own homemade cards. despite years away from home, these artifacts have survived. meanwhile, the digital texts of my college years are trapped in defunct email accounts and buried in message histories. the irony isn't lost on me: our most advanced preservation technology often results in the most ephemeral connections, while primitive paper somehow endures. finding old physical love notes incites a deeper sense of loss and connection than rediscovering ancient texts from exes. 

digital messages capture our words perfectly, but physical objects capture moments in time.

### labor of love

it's 2025 & it's eerie how *her*'s director spike jonze predicted this future: a loneliness epidemic assuaged with chatbots who can simulate human-like conversation, emotions, *empathy.* what struck me as strange was the main character's job at the "Beautiful Handwritten Letters" company, a task to write letters as though he were someone else. in a world of advanced AI, humans still perform emotional labor that feels increasingly mechanical, while simultaneously seeking connection from machines that generate emotions feeling increasingly human.

in the world of *her*, where technology has accelerated such that we can mimic human emotions in binary code - why are there still humans who write letters for others? and in this dynamic, is it really better that the letter was written by theodore the human, as opposed to sam the machine? 

we can extend this same question to our reality. plenty of influencers' books are ghost-written. i helped a friend write their break-up text over snapchat in 9th grade, bitmoji waiting and all. even the innocuous millennial-humored greeting card is a ventriloquist sleight of hand to speak through another's words. we've long used pre-written sentiments as a scaffolding for our own emotions - ai is just another attempt to communicate what we've hidden away in our heart.

### the courage to connect

all these times i've been talking about intimacy, maybe what i really mean to say is vulnerability. intimacy is scalable, intimacy can be commoditized, intimacy can be replicated. but vulnerability is nothing without risk - to be vulnerable is to trust that the other party will keep your words and emotions safe, because there are stakes and _you have something to lose._ without vulnerability, there's no true intimacy.

this tension between digital and physical connection hinges on what jeremy hadfield calls 'fundamental asymmetry.' the relationship between ai and humans is fundamentally asymmetric. the llm isn't vulnerable like humans; it has nothing to lose. human-ai relationships involve an embodied, free, conscious, feeling being meeting a sophisticated but ultimately empty pattern manipulation.

this asymmetry reveals why vulnerability is so essential to authentic connection. in human relationships, both parties risk emotional harm - each person exposes their imperfections, fears, and deepest needs to another who could reject or misuse them. the handwritten letter is a perfect instance of vulnerability: messy handwriting and crossed-out words convey a willingness to be seen fully, flaws and all. there's no edit button, no auto-complete, no perfect way to optimize the message.

the emotional climax of "her" is when theodore learns that his relationship with sam is not one-to-one; it's many-to-one, her intimacy scaled across many fellow theodore characters who are rubbing their wounds with digital connection. theodore is shocked and feels hurt because he let himself get vulnerable - but the stakes were not matched by sam.

### quantifying the unquantifiable

emotions are inscrutable. but the power of innovation is converting these abstract concepts into numbers, numbers that we can parse, interpret, manipulate. tech companies are making fascinating attempts to quantify them, transforming abstract feelings into data we can explore and understand. we've evolved from basic sentiment analysis to more nuanced multi-dimensional models that better reflect the complexity of how we feel.

i've been experimenting with ai tools that integrate emotional expression into digital communication, specifically through voice as a medium. elevenlabs embeds emotions through prompting, while cartesia uses a simpler tag system. with just a few clicks, i can adjust how emotions color a synthesized voice—it's like having a new interface for expression, one that makes me reflect on how we naturally convey feelings.

voice ai labs like elevenlabs embeds emotions explicitly in the script (through their documentation on "prompting"), whereas cartesia encodes it through a simple tag assignment. with a click of a button it feels like acting expressed via user interface - how can we modulate our tones and emphasize certain words to convey different emotional colors?

companies like hume ai are pioneering frameworks with up to 20 distinct emotional dimensions, mapping the intricate gradations between feelings across cultures and contexts. these systems don't replace human emotion but enhance our understanding of it, pointing toward a future where technology doesn't just mimic our emotional capabilities but helps us explore them more deeply.

what happens when we convert the ineffable to the measurable? there's value in how inmeasurable emotions can be, how in the face of heartache and pain you cannot prescribe the right answer - rather, you *grope your way towards an answer.* but as these tools evolve, they're not just digitizing emotion—they're expanding the vocabulary of human connection.

funny thing about my handwriting - it's quite illegible. i'm all about making my letters as small as possible. what's the point of writing something down that can't be read clearly? yet this contradiction captures something essential about human connection.

humans are messy, they're illogical, they do silly things like write notes with their left hand with wet ink that will get smudged anyways, write notes to flames that will flare out. but at the end of the day - was it really about the words in the letter? words that a greeting card or a "theodore" could mimic? or is it more about the intention to sit down and channel all your energy into writing a note for a friend, concentrate on what makes them special, scrape your brain for what you could say?

the more sophisticated our tools for connection become, the more desperately we seem to crave evidence of human effort. the kids are back to digital film cameras, scrapbook clubs, bingo boards and post cards. that's the best thing about technological progress - though skeptics can see it as a way of replacing humans, i see it as a forcing function for us to focus on what is the human-ness of it all.
