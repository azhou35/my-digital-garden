john lee call:
talked to aditya the other da and he provided some context

Background on me:
- worked w aditya under kurt 
- seen a lot changes
been in supercomputing for past 25 years
bg in hw
* - "How would you describe your management style and how you prefer to communicate with your team?"
- "What are the biggest challenges the team is currently facing that this role would help address?"*
- - "How have you helped previous team members grow in their careers?"
- management style
	- servant leadership
- career goals
	- emerging tech 
- data sciences
- 2-3 years
- customer engagement
- demotivate me - beauoracy - handshake meetings
- 
charter is to make sure oai's training mission is succcessful
ultimately respons for building infra oai intends to build the next gen of models
use all the
accelerate
area where we need
scope is operationl aspect 

see a lot of room to grow here
decent job of catering to oai's needs to best
decet job with planned maintenance
admin tools to help them manage things like planned main
o(1) operations
the best cloud for ai supercomputing
team has resources that ai inonovators like oai want
supporting oai 
scale that to other ai innovators like microsoft ai
making subset of capabilities and 
investment 
where can i raise the ceiling

* happiness on OAI project
	* what im ding right now 
	* and it doesnt make sense to do it under jack
	* constantly feel this friction of howmy work helps jack
	* hidnering my growth 
	* from the ppl i directly work with like amy , aditya, prabhat
		* i see a lot of growth potential 
		* and great feedback from the ppl i directly work w
		* my fear is not lined up w jacks orks right now
		* and this is a fear ive validated with other pms who have worked on loan for oai and their expeirence was misaligned with their skip's priorities and ultimately it didnt play out well
* when it comes to career tho i believe bieng on your team makes the most sense bc of the three goals i have w my career
1. business impact
2. internal alignment 
3. growth potential
	1. i want to be empowered to grow fast
	2. i think some of the coordination and lack of context from teammates or upper leadership 

things i look forward to:
doing more gb200 operations 
working more closely to startups, working more closely to supercomputing infra

questions:
john what is ur vision 

valuing his opinion 

**Purpose:**

- The O1 initiative was introduced as part of the planned maintenance efforts to ensure the optimal performance and reliability of supercomputing systems used by OpenAI.
- as we've mentioned before, 
- The overall goal is to prevent unexpected failures & minimize downtime for customers 
- Crucial for OAI's training workloads, which are highly sensitive to disruptions 
	- Even a brief interupption leads to sig financial losses
- this means scheduling software and hardware updates to a system 
- O(1) is based off of the classical programming concept, where you can do operations in either a constant time (o1) or an exponential/linear fashion (e.g. o(n)) 
- think of it as a way to measure how long an update takes - a key ask from the customer is for every operation to complete across the entire supercomputing cluster in the same time it takes for one node
	- thus, an ask for updates to roll out in o(1) time 
-  In the past, when we run an update on the size of a general fleet cluster vs oai, the difference in scale is massive 
- It's a totally new experience to run these updates at scale - how can we adapt the way that we roll out an update as the cluster size scales? 
- - things break at this scale - there are internal limits and thresholds and bottlenecks to the processes that teams undergo that need to be remediated
- Our goal driving this initiative would be to collect info from internal smes to a) understand what is the theoretical o(1) number
ill pass it off to diego to takl a little bit about the workstreams we've been driving

**Planned Maintenance Process:**

- Involves scheduled hardware and software updates.
- Aims to prevent unexpected failures and minimize downtime for customers.
- Crucial for OpenAI's training workloads, which are highly sensitive to disruptions.
- Even brief interruptions can lead to significant financial losses due to the nature of AI workloads.

claude advice:
- unfair advantage: few ppl who understand ai infra. workloads, gpu supercomputing

"Just as an elephant has to eat hundreds of pounds of food per day just to sustain itself, giant companies need thousands of employees just to sustain their internal processes. Innovation and research require more “food” on top of that; in principle, you could have some employees work on sustaining and some employees work on innovating, but in practice, both get smeared across all employees to varying degrees. As a result, the ratio of productive-to-bureaucratic work for any given person goes down as the company gets larger. There are some lucky few who get to focus most on productive tasks and spend less time in handshake-style meetings, but those positions aren’t the norm and take a long time to earn."

I once spoke to a real architect (who designs buildings) who described his job as gathering requirements from the people who will use a building, understanding external constraints governing the building, and then designing something that will work based on that. That’s surprisingly similar to what I’ve done as a system architect. The big difference is that I design _computer infrastructure_ instead of _building infrastructure_.
