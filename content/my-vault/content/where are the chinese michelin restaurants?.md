title: "where are the chinese michelin restaurants?"
---

eg why is there nothing w a list w the best chinese restaurants

- why are there no michelin star chinese restaurants
			- obv answer: there's an inherent price ceiling for our willingness to pay for chinese food vs japanese
				- my counter: fine mexican / latam exists despite cheap perceptions 
			- my answer: textural differences / fine dining takes an ingredient and isolates an element and puts a spin, hard to isolate elments of chinese food like soysauce
				- vinnys counter: spicy food 
					- my counter - michelin doesnt rlly like spicy
			- why dont we have a restaurant w the regional specialty across china ? 
			- jess - from guangdi, lots of suancai, ru luo shi aka snail noodles
			- vinny - wuzhounese, by port
