title: "2025 reflection - draft 2"
---

picture this: the water irresistably blue, the soft silhouette of the rolling hills. the city looks best from a distance, perched up high in alta plaza.  

viewpoints are voyeuristic, the way it places you separate from your surroundings. it's as if the world has opened itself for you, oyster shell ajar, the world posing for a picture.

the camera mirrors human sight -- focus, aperture, field of vision -- and it also serves as the lens by which i perceive my surroundings. an airplane window is a narrow aperture, forcing a world into a frame, compressing a city that once felt so big into a narrow pinhole. thanks to distance, things look simpler. serpetine highways collapse into grid-like systems, unpredictable humans become specks of dust against the window screen. 

it's all about framing, really. do i see my life as days in between flights, or the hours spent untangling my anxieties like a knotted-up fur ball? or do i zoom out and see the map i'm trying to author?

i like to quip that as a lifetime east coaster, *im not used to seeing trees this big.*  the sequioa redwoods tower above the consistent layer of fog, and you have to wonder how something so large has been able to sustain a lifetime of over 3000 years. the trees serve as constant reminder: long after our feeble efforts to change the landscape, they will continue to outlast you.

in the face of awe, i feel small & insignificant. i embrace this feeling, because these moments remind me that i am part of a greater whole. that i'm just a mote of dust on a floating rock, but at least we're in it together. i threaded together 2025 through these moments: in queens, swaying to the tune of *take me to the ballgame;* at the bleachers of edc, watching lights explode like fireworks at the matroda set; in catskills, seeing the stars stretch impossibly above as incandescent tapestry. 

i yearn for connection, but i also value my individuation. i fear losing myself, thus oscillating between motion and belonging. 

unmoored by anchors, an idle mind drifts easily to intrusive questions. i've spent the larger part of last year so-called *[staring into the abyss](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/ )*, circling certain questions like a stray cat nursing a half-eaten kill.  

yesterday was the first of january. january, named after *janus*, god of entries and doorways. frames and endings. doorways exist for you to step in and out. but i habitually linger in-between, within a core set of tensions. since last january, i've been sifting through my internal monologue, trying to sort out my values and priorities. since then i've determined two working theories.

I. *it's easy to get along with everyone - infinitely harder to get them to stay* 

since i was young, my quest was to be friends with anyone and everyone. this year i realized it's easier to be universally well-liked, harder to be consistently chosen.

intimacy is not a proxy for closeness. initial sparks cannot sustain an enduring hearth. its societally acceptable for friends to pick things over you - career, family, even other friends - and there's no expectation to post-mortem a foregone friendship.

i've reframed my infinite game as a search for the people on the same wavelength as me. we are all dictated by own personal incentives - rather than try to change this, find those driven by complementary compulsions. as henrik karlsonsenn describes, you aren't just just an average of the five people around you - it's all *relational*. 
![[Pasted image 20260101160340.png]] 
i take this to mean: the combination of your two inputs - how you meet in conversation - should create something uniquely generative. in statistics, there's the notion of an *interaction term*. take X and Y, both which affect an outcome - if they are independent, their effect is separate. an interaction term (X × Y) says: the way X affects the outcome depends on Y, i.e. X and Y together produce something new that neither produces alone.

when i consider my close friends, i think of the qualities they have that i admire. conversations w j teach me how to show up as a good friend, how to be a good host, how to be uber-intentional. s curates a wardrobe of vintage shoes and coats, is ready with camera recs at my beck and call, and helped me bring the vision of a photo gallery to life in june. 
 
the people i stuck close to were those who shared a common ethos. & sometimes the fabric that ties you together with other people isn't obvious - the ethos can be as simple as *I care about this group of people and I will show up, over and over again.* intention needs to be *sustained* - to cook food together, to linger at the doorway after a home-cooked meal. the people who show up to the pre-game and the afters, who come to set up and clean up afterwards. 

as well as being fellow skeptics 
			- me and v and j love to sit ont the floor and play catan 
		- if everyone is operating by some specified formula, a successful relationship is one where you recombinate the equations. 
			- people are all driven by internal incentives and you cant change them
			- you can only align yourself with the people on the same wavelength as you 
		- can't just be achieved by hanging out with "cool people" who have started companies or built up brands or curate their social medias. 
		- "but it is important to note that curating your milieu isn't only or even primarily about being picky. it is about how you relate to people."
		- intimacy is not a proxy for closeness. its ok for friends to pick things over you - career, family, even other friends. there's no post-mortem to a faded friendship.
		- but that makes the people who stick by you all the more meaningful.  i found that the people i stuck close to were those who shared a common ethos - and sometimes that ethos is as simple as I care about this friend group and I will show up, over and over again. relationships that sustain care. 
in other words - it's easy to be universally well-liked, harder to be consistently chosen. 
		- i resist ambien 
ii. *the longer you deny yourself alignment, the less optionality matters* 

i long understood authenticity as a core life value - it's why i agonize over representing myself well on social platforms designed to flatten its users, it's why i strive to show up in my complete self in all convos. early 2025 i was proud of myself for living a well-balanced life. the only nagging feeling was re: my job - i felt like i was wasting time. previously, i convinced myself i could live a complete 5-9 to offset the ennui in my 9-5. 

a year of muddling through teams and a windows computer, it became clear i couldn't do this forever. a 9-5 is still 40 hours a week. when your work drains you - even in its inactivity - it’s hard to muster energy for anything outside it. 

in 2025 i sought alignment: that is, how do i create a life that is so attuned to my values? alignment is downstream of valuing *authenticity* - in order to act in accordance with values and desires, it necessitates at continuous negotiation and callibration of my inputs. intuition is a fine-toothed arrow, but a finnicky one at that. it points you towards the work you run towards, even if it means living in uncertainty.

i get frustrated when people tell me *i need to stay in this job at least 2 years* - which is prob why i never went into finance / consulting. we're wired to preserve optionality: but a dream deferred is just as bad as a dream wrinkled up.

trying to find Your Thing is is in tension with preserving optionality. fantasizing about a new job is almost more fun than the actual process. every decision was agony: whether i turned down a company or it rejected me, it felt like a door shutting in my face. 

it's difficult to forecast outcomes. inputs are the only thing under our control: the frameworks and values that guide our daily decision-making. i.e., i can't control whether this substack ever blows up, but i *can* control following my intellectual curiosity, working hard, and writing regularly. 

---

we are free to design a life that is best fit for us in all dimensions. designing a life doesn't need to prescribe results, but it demands you choose your inputs and constraints. i want a job that impacts people, demands focus, sits at the edge of technology, and allows me to work both technically and collaboratively. i want a life that is: well-balanced, opening me to new eperiences, involves bringing people together. today, i may not be at the final state, but i'm happy to say i'm directionally correct. 

in 2026, 


- without fundamentals, beauty collapses
	- social media prioritizes *trends* - if you think your pinterest feeds look alike, its bc they prioritize aesthetics. aesthetics are so easily consumable by the glazed-over viewer
	- a decent photo has framing, color, light and shadow. Most photos begin and end here, in rule-of-thirds compositions and sunset silhouettes.
	- resonance happens when all four layers - aesthetics, story, motion, and alchemy - align to create something so powerful it vibrates
	- without story, motion, alchemy.

- i saw this with film photography - i desired the grainy aesthetic, the sepia colors, that evoked nostalgia and provoked emotion. 
	- but i struggled to understand how light gathered in the lens 
	- or the right distance between you and the subject
**Layer Two: Subject & Story**  
	- platonic ideal of food 
		- picky picky eater 
		- what goes into an ideal pastry:
			- buttery, flaky
			- it shows good technique 
		- without a concrete fundamental the pastry itself falls apart
			- e.g. bad croissants in sd
- it's easier to build rather than maintain
	- in my old apartment my parents gifted me a money tree 
		- i always forget to water it
	- starting is exciting, monumental, easy to point to 
	- lifestyle creep - the urge to buy something new to nurse an internal wound
	- i have a trigger finger when it comes to creating a new ig account 
	- a new side hustle, a new theme 
	- did quite well in achieving the first pass of all my aspirations - one cafe, one photo gallery
	- sustained activity of writing club
