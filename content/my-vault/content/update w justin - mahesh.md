title: "update w justin - mahesh"
---

so many connections to nitin's inner circle (whom im meeting tonight)
1. ryan chang ( mike tan related, justin knows from contrary, has been building for 3 years)
	1. prob good friends w raymond, who is nitins BEST friend, who is also dating a pm from microsoft in sf
2. evan shen (nitins roommie/incoming left lane cap analyst/brother of justin shen lightspeed partners dude from berkeley that cat zhao knows) 
3. stephanie tang (girl that evan is seeing ish from shanghai who def knows my high school peers who do princeton's dance teams and prob bev shen maheshs ex's roommate / chloe's friend who also did dance)
nitin, ryan, and evan are all meeting up with andy zhou, who i had met last summer at amazon and who i FEEL like there were vibes between us and curtis was weirdly super jealous of him even tho nothing happened and andy got intro'ed to my cmu bestie stepho and now theyre seeing each other but andy is not very proactive / intent on a relationship so stepho is frustrated and he clearly has time if hes tryna meet up w random duke dudes 
michael tan lore:
1. apparently he and nitins bestie amanda were hooking up in like freshman year in a non serious way but then michaels new girlfriend (kinda fobby) was rlly upset whenever they were in the same room also his new gf was like lowkey psychotic and said some crazy things and at first mike was like this is not serious idc but then overnight he randomly got super simpy for her and serious and then they had bad breakup and now miek tan is super gatekeepy about his new gf like none of his friends know who she is and nitin rlly wants to find out what company she works at so he can stalk 

annie - no one knows me i just know everything
