today i wnet back home and sorted thru old k-12 items with my sister in our childhood home 
notable how we skipped over the math equations and derivatives and science lab books - the only artifacts we wanted to keep were from english class
i saw a manifold of old notebooks all proof of my habit of observation - notes written after pangs of jealousy in middle school, travel journals from a time on a cruise, general incoherent mess when contemplating important decisions. 
there's two things that have never changed: my love for bunnies and a love for writing. i doodle endlessly in class notes and even imagined a whole world of a fake superhero rabbit. 
i tend to rabbit hole myself into traps.
