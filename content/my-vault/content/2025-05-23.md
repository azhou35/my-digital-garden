push me and i fall 
mai starting their job at october 1 

Bhumi,
not like to have more than 6 hour downtime
how can we break these colos up 
if ur job can survive without certain colos 

set some context on planned maintenance windows for cluster at this scale
for prev planned maintenance for oai has taken anywhere from 12 - 48 hours
but theyre predisiposed to minimize nuber of maintenance windows and stack lots of updates all at once
we've made improvements from our end to reduce this time window 
like some of the hpc tasks like repave 
as well as tracked improvements across all the update owners 
i know diego and aditya are driving o(1) discussion 
but we may want to reviist the 6 hour sla 
share some data on how long this takes 
merge this w what mitara has shared
list of impactless vs impactful updates
categories of times 

downtime 6 hour duration 

LAst one for GB200 took over 2 days
Whos on the Ops PM Team
