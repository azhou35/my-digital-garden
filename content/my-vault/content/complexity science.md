Systems science is the interdisciplinary study of "systems"; that is, nonlinear, auto-organizing processes that manage to maintain some sort of input/output flow. The idea is that there are universal aspects of systems (their organization, dynamics, structure, evolution) that can be applied to all sciences to help better understand them.

Complexity theory is linked as systems are what create and maintain complexity. Complexity theory is an attempt to explain synergistic and emergent effects that are caused when systems work in certain ways that can't be explained with reductionism. The best example of this is the motion of liquid water. A water molecule by itself is still water, but only through the interaction of many molecules can it display emergent behaviors that we associate with liquid water. Reductionism couldn't predict that liquid water would act that way by just observing a water molecule.

Both of these topics arose because of computers and their ability to simulate very complex processes. It's also influenced by chaos theory—that there might be predictability in a system's seemingly unpredictable dynamic processes.
