Some ideas as you continue to explore your value system:

- Ask yourself: "What do I like about this world? What pains me about this world?" This helps you develop taste for what is beautiful, as well as what is discordant, unjust, ugly, wrong.
- Be present. To notice anything requires presence. What does your Uber driver's voice sound like? Are you more numb today than yesterday to the presence of unhoused people on your walk to work?
- Pay attention to the metaphors you use. What do they connote about how you view the people around you?
- Explore what answers different ethical traditions and theories of value might give you, and then construct your own answer as to the way you should be and act.
- Recognize ethical tensions when they arise; you don't have to push back right away when your boss asks you to scope out a certain feature, but you can note the tension and shelve your reaction to revisit and examine later.
- Seek to understand your situatedness in broader systems of power, even when your immediate day to day work does not surface ethical tensions to you; reflect on your own locus of control and your sense of agency.
