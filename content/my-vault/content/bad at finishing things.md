title: "bad at finishing things"
---

i hate fullness. 
swollen stomach
my parents insist i finish my drink, lick my plate clean.
in protest, i stop halfway. 
i am bad at finishing things. my eyes are bigger than my stomach. my appetite outpaces my discipline. abandoned creative projects. 
filling each other up is a love language. this is the one act of self-love i refuse to do. i prefer weightlessness that comes from starving.
a bloated belly presses against my waistline.
