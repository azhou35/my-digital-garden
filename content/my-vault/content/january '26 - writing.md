	- - In-depth case studies of how AI is playing out in your industry — the more specific, the better.
	- Interviews with experts about what current models are and aren’t useful for in their work.
	- Stories of similar instances of historical tech diffusion.
	- Thoughtful discussions of the strengths, weaknesses, and methodologies of economic impact benchmarks like [GDPeval](https://openai.com/index/gdpval/) or the [Anthropic Economic Index](https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index).
	- - How Deepseek is actually diffusing in China: [Shallow, Narrow, and Slow](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-321-deepseek-spreads-across?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=2660&post_id=168739110&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=75jj6&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)
	- Pitch us! Describe the article you want to write and how it will inform our understanding of AI diffusion. We expect articles to be 2-4k words. If you would like to do another format of article e.g. video, podcast, interview, let us know here as well.

	- We are primarily looking to commission long-form features that centre on one specific family and their project. These can take one of two forms:
	- **Research-led or investigative features** that explore a family-run project through reporting, interviews, and historical or cultural context
	- **Personal essays** about your own family project — one you are part of, grew up around, or are directly connected to
		Stories may be written in the first or third person. In both cases, we are interested in how individual experiences intersect with larger questions of time, labour, heritage, and family dynamics.
		We are particularly drawn to stories that incorporate or reference **archival materials** — photographs, documents, menus, letters, or other family records. The ability to include scans or images of these archives as part of the final story is a major plus.

	- Time, memory, and the passage of time
