* Welcome to this multilayered three-story suburban home, situated in a peaceful, static neighborhood, where i used to play with the kids in the forest and bring fresh produce to their parents. Upon entry, you're greeted by an open foyer adorned with a classic chandelier, classy for the sake of classy, the one my dad haggled for with the guy from Chinatown. In the foyer remember all the ai yi's and su su's who'd linger there after a party, chatting because they didn't want to leave. In this foyer you feel **热闹** for the first time. A deep, untranslatable feeling, where happy voices echo off the high ceilings in a multilingual blend. 
* Inside, the main floor features a piano room, vacant and hollow, void of the little girl sneaking games of battle cats in between scales and bleeding her fingers dry on the pads of her clarinet. But the real music is next to it in the kitchen boasting modern appliances (the rice cooker who sings "pop goes the weasel," the kettle humming a low boil, the radio my mom keeps on for comfor) and ample storage for all the snacks of my childhood:.
