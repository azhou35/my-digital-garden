convo:
- I sometimes feel torn trying to balance big career opportunities and our shared priorities
- default is still nyc
- i want to make sure you feel secure in these convos
- i feel like we need to separate the relationship from location
- openness doesnt mean destabilize it
- difficult convo w nitin where he said he feels upset that even tho im not at the end of the option pool im still feeling tihis way 
- he feels deeply that he would prioritize our happiness and family over a job but its not clear i feel the same way 
- feels like im overvaluing fireworks and undervaluing my skillset 
- feels like hes a bind where either 1) i choose not to take the job and i resent him for stopping me 2) i dont feel like nitin is restricing me which means i dont feel strongly about the life we built together  choose the job and i feel bad about everything 
- upset i called the city a constraint rather something we choose 
- thought we were in alignment over nyc
- upset that we keep having this back and forth about sf vs nyc and that every time i go thru job serch i will go thru this
- shaken up by this bc theres no happy resolution
