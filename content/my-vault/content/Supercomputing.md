1) Unlike traditional computers, supercomputers use more than one CPU 
	1) CPUs grouped into compute noes
	2) Comprising a processor or group of processors (symmetric multiprocessing) and a memory block
	3) Supercomputer contains 10k thousands of nodes
	4) Interconnect allows nodes to collab on solving a specifcic problem 
2) Supercomputing is measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS)
	1) Petfalops: measure of computer's processing speed equal to a thousand trillion flops
	2) 1 - petaflop computer system can perform one quadrillion flops
Supercomputing refers to the process of complex calculations used by supercomputers
HPC is the use of multiple supercomputing
