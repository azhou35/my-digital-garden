summarizing my thoughts on ai art
- art is a series of choices and internal strife 
attention is all you need 
- this line has been etched into my head 

what is the purpose of art?
* is it aesthetics? how it adheres to visual 

This might be easiest to explain if we use fiction writing as an example. When you are writing fiction, you are—consciously or unconsciously—making a choice about almost every word you type; to oversimplify, we can imagine that a ten-thousand-word short story requires something on the order of ten thousand choices. When you give a generative-A.I. program a prompt, you are making very few choices; if you supply a hundred-word prompt, you have made on the order of a hundred choices.
* how is the ai making the choices behind the scene? 

* intention is crucial to what you should spend ur attention 
	* intention in relationships, intention in how you spend ur time, intention in what you consume
* attention algorithms
