In college, my best friend Mind and I would spend our weekends treading the slopes of Ithaca. We held this ritual sacred. We’d talk about what we value, the projects we were working on, and how they’ve informed one another and evolved. Without knowing where our lives lead, we felt optimistic and empowered that we’re building things in line with what we value, and we knew that these long walks helped, having each other to grasp the known in the unknown.

_“You’re hungry, and you’re curious, but you gotta pick something you love and stay focused. When you leave school, the world will look quite different from now.”_ My boss stroked the spines of a stack of books on his desks. Most of them seemed to be about AI, some about blockchain.
_What if we share what we do for each other with a larger group? What if the true obstacle to finding a fulfilling career isn’t the finding, but the understanding of ourselves and our values? What if the answer is within us all along, it just takes courage and support to embrace it?_

We hosted our first workshop as an experiment at Cornell with a group of 30 friends. Then we brought it to San Francisco, and also to NYC. Most of the attendees were people we’ve never met. One of these attendees came up to us after the workshop, on the brink of tears. She just quit her full-time job and was grateful that there’s a safe space in the world for her to dream a bit for just herself. The reaction was much more than what we were prepared for.

[[FKPXLS] SPECIAL VOLUME: JOINING PACE - by Tina He](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-joining-pace?r=10nm&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=linkedin)
The first time I reached out to [Jordan](https://twitter.com/jordancooper) was on Twitter. I told him I was a fan of his blog and appreciated how openly he discussed his experiences — both his successes and setbacks — particularly as they pertain to people my age, those still on the first leg of what always seemed a long journey.

During our initial conversation, Jordan said little about his past accomplishments. Instead, he peppered me with questions about my background, and, hearing that I loved to write, mentioned the reading groups he used to organize in the early days of the then-burgeoning crypto community. The group typically read a different whitepaper each week and then met afterward to teach each other what they’d learned.
_If you open yourself up to others by letting them know what you’re interested in, others will do the same for you,_ Jordan said. That was all I needed to hear to begin writing publicly again. If I started a writing club would you be willing to participate, I asked. _Absolutely_, Jordan replied.
Chris compared Jordan’s openness to that of an API’s — the type of frank transparency Chris found conducive to a strong partnership. It didn’t take long after that for me to recognize Chris’s mastery of  metaphor. Chris compared the state of the world and the broken systems that inhabit it to faulty dams gradually crumbling down. Value, like streams of water bursting through the floodgates, is now in the process of redistributing itself to new terrains.
_Only through a close study of the current terrain can we possibly shape the new frontiers, so that value is distributed to places and people that will benefit from it the most,_ Chris said_._ I found comfort in Chris’ metaphors. Because in metaphor lives nuance — the space between absolutes — where the right answers are not always obvious, let alone easy.
