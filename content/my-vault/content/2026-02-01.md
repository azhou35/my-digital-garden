lucky cat cafe

what is luck, really?  

for me, it's finding my best friend the first week of orientation, a sticky day where vinny came over and let me use his personal electric fan. it's moving to a city and meeting the friends of your friends, and finding they are just as lovely as your mutual. 

vinny and i have always bonded over a love for books and good eats (even when upstate ny didn't offer much of the latter...). and tho we both took winding paths post-college, "good" fortune brought us back to the same city here in san francisco.

we want to make more space for serendipity - new friends & familiar faces alike, easy conversation, little sparks. as perennial east-coasters, we hope sf feels more like a cozy living room by sharing our favorite treats! 

thanks to everyone who came to our first cafe of 2026 -- bringing books for our shared library & taking photos. vinny & i made red bean matcha w cheese foam, homemade ichigo daifuku, scallion pancake bec, & black sesame cheesecake.

excited to host more cozy cafes and welcome new friends in lucky cat club!!

"we feasted, we laughed, we played games, lost and won, we told the best stories. and each week, we could hope to be lucky. that hope was our only joy. and that's how we came to call our little parties joy luck."
