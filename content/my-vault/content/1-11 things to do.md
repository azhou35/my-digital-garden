title: "1-11 things to do"
---

- make call on phx60 - u should just do it on thursday
- start a post mortem on week 1 for azure
	- remember to call out what processes/systems they should build to make this easier next time
	- why is a full cluster maintenance so high touch compared to CW or GCP 
		- GCP goes in the bg 
		- CW i trust 
	- highlight the key wins and thanks 
	- we appreciate ur work - infra is a thankless job where you expect near-perfect reliability/performance and allow little affordance for downtime or blips 
	- this maintenance was a healthy reminder that
		- this is unavoidable
		- this is necessary 
	- at the same time this maintenance revealed a lot of weaknesses in our system - or lack thereof
		- feedback to them
		- feedback to ourselves
	- analogy: its as if the mta suddenly had transformers about to explode and needed to replace all of them in two weeks
		- we should get to a point where it is not impossible to our current systems to enable these maintenances
		- i want to be like the japanese shinkansen where u allow downtime
	- to get that time we need
		- trust
		- better systems
		- more resources/better allocation of such 
		- buyin from ur other infra stakeholders
		- operational flywheels
		- let us trust u that u will pursue better systems
- what documents/artifacts should i produce?
	- open letter to Fleet on how to make this easier 
		- start w story of metro
	- feedback to azure
