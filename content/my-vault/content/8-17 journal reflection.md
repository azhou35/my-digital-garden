title: "8-17 journal reflection"
---

controlling my weight took highest priority -- did pretty well 
almost one year since ive left for copenhagen -- in a different place-- im "settled" ??? what am i striving for? 
everyone has a "breakpoint" -- whats yours?
i worry -- i think the less of a gravitational pull i have towards a group of girlies, the more likely ill fall into a relationship AH
i write well in resopnse to emotion -- what emotion do i feel right now?
i iss being a kid and anything im doing garners praise
i do have a praise kink in a way
