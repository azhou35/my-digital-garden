1. (木漏れ日) komorebi: the sunlight that filters and shines thru the trees. a love letter to the quiet moments of the city in transition, from winter to spring, spring to summer. in a world that is ever-moving, stillness becomes an act of rebellion. shadow of leaves against the pavement, moments of peace in reflections. spring rain falls and the leaves unfurl gently, fists opening into palms.
