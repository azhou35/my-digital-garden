title: "notes on coney"

there is something distinctly foreboding about entering a man-made space that is devoid of its makers; a space that tries to move on when its outlived its use case. 
there are artifacts, for sure; the lone man hunting for metal, the strip of vacated fast food chains. and then there's the things that remain unchanging: the sky, the sand, the shoreline. 
last time i went to coney island was in high school summer. it was my first time really picking up a camera, back when brandon woelfel was all the rage. i was pretty bad but thought i was great, and extreme in my earnestness. i hope i returned a little less bad, but equally as earnest. 
there's this quote i read in middle school: *and Spring herself, when she woke at dawn / Would scarcely know that we were gone*

facing the cloudless haze that could swallow me whole i ask - what does it mean to fear the sky?
