	- my boyfriend works at finance
	- dad used to work in finance
	- literally live on wallstreet
	- building for financial services has always been my priority 
	- from talking to financial institutions about their pain points for workflow orchestrators
	- deeply aware of how knotty and complex building on their workloads can be and how to work with AI applicationsou to be auditable and transparent 
	- finance is about seeing the long game 
	- i am so bull on the importance of exceptional service and how to think and work with the sharpest minds - this is where product is key, where you're not selling software as a service but trust
	- product thinking is the great unlock, seeing around the corner to anticipate customer needs 
	- i want to work to challenge frontier AI challenges in finance
