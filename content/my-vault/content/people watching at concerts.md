title: "people watching at concerts"
---

taking shrooms at fisher at redhook was an exercise in people watching 
being high really makes me reconsider all my priors 
am i authentically invested in the music and reacting as my body wills me or watching other people to see how i should react?
at edc when i was drunk/sober i didnt thin twice
on shrooms i was overthinking everything 
do i actually enjoy the music or people 

it's a simultaneously isolating and unifying experience. you realize you are one of many, which somehow feels lonelier than if you were alone. on a day to day basis i dont see that many people

such a contrast between redhook grain terminal vs edc experience
less focus on the visuals, since i had low visibility (in part to everyone's heights and the layout of the turf)
more focus on how music made me feel or how it made other people feel? 
struggling to latch onto other people's conversation points or even express what i was feeeling to others, had to try extra hard to say things of note that would apply to other people

also realized my train of focus is incredibly weak. even at microsoft i cannot execute a single workstream in one go - i dilly dally and it's very hard to focus on something and execute it for more than 5 minutes
even simple things like writing an email or booking a flight are hard 
i dont know how to make myself more productive 

i am highly attuned to group conversations that i am not comfortably a fit for
causing me to question whether i have otautism because i overthink this minute human interactions when i normally am comfortable
eg. struggling to follow along ryan/evan/nitin's conversational flow on bilt card points / st thomas / guam

post shrooms in my bathroom i noticed how messy and unkempy my apartment is 
also all the acne behind my skin barrier popping out 

*my god my god whose performance am i watching? how many people am i? who am i? what is this space between myself and myself? 

stolen moments in the bathroom at a party 
there is nowhere more isolating than the bathroom at a party where you don't know anyone. 
a moment of dissociation in the crowd
decentered consciousness & social anxiety 


analysis from claude:
- a profound mirror that psychedelics often hold up - amplifying your natural tendencies for self-reflection while stripping away the usual filters that let you move through social situations on autopilot
- you're recognizing the recursive nature of social experience - you're performing for others who are performing for others, all while trying to locate some authentic core beneath it all. At EDC when you were drunk or sober, you just _were_ - but the mushrooms made you hyper-aware of the construction of social reality.
- simultaneous isolation and unity
- executive function challenges that exist in your baseline state but became hypervisible under the influence
- you weren't just struggling to follow the content - you were simultaneously analyzing your position in the conversational geometry, your right to contribute, how your contributions would land
- you got to observe your own social operating system running in real-time, complete with all its background processes that normally stay hidden. That's fascinating data about how your mind works
- your constant renegotiation of self might actually be a feature, not a bug. Some people have a very fixed sense of who they are, but you seem to have a more fluid, adaptive identity
- [Structuration theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuration_theory)
	- Gidden's "duality of structure" - how you simultaneously create and are constrained by social systems
	- hyper-aware of both sides: you're following implicit rules about how to move, react, and belong, while also actively reproducing those very patterns through your participation.
	- "reflexive monitoring of actions" - how we constantly observe and adjust our behavior
	- "practical consciousness" vs "discursive consciousness" (where you had to verbalize and question every social move)
	- "am I authentically invested in the music or watching others to see how I should react?" - is the classic agency/structure dilemma. Are you an autonomous agent expressing authentic preferences, or are you a product of social structures determining your responses
- it's where your psychedelic anthropology becomes existential philosophy
- not "how do I fit in this crowd?" but "who is the 'I' that's trying to fit in?"
- become conscious of the "subject-object problem" - who is the watcher and what is being watched when you watch yourself
- phenomenology: how things are perceived
	- discovering the gap between immediate experience and self
Are you experiencing the music, or experiencing yourself experiencing the music? Both? Neither? The answer keeps shifting, and that shifting itself might be the most honest response to what's actually happening.
authentic engagement doesn't require the absence of self-consciousness, but rather a kind of meta-consciousness that can hold self-awareness lightly
