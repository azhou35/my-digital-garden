Notice that we’re not defining technology as a solution to a problem, but rather a path to an end. Though many technologists see their work as “problem-solving”, problems are in the eye of the beholder; one first has to _make decisions_ about what constitutes a problem before _making decisions_ to solve it in a particular way. That decision-making process is prior to and more fundamental than the problem-solving process.  
  
Joseph Dunne points out that, when confronted with a problematic situation, “one is not calculating the efficiency of different possible means towards an already determined end. Rather, one is often deliberating about the end itself: about what would count as a satisfactory, or at least not entirely unacceptable, outcome to a particular ‘case’".2 Making technology involves an ongoing attempt to bring the world closer to the way one wishes it to be. The technologist actively participates in determining _what that wish is_, rather than having clearly defined problems handed to them.
In contrast, technology is highly instrumental; it’s all about pursuing various goals using tools.  
  
Consequently, in its idealized form the scientific method limits freedom of the will, while technology amplifies freedom of the will. Technology is by no means derived with certainty. It is the extremely particular result of someone’s will, based on rationalizing through the concrete and contingent circumstances of the world.  
  
We are not pursuing “truth”; we are exploiting “truth”.
 I propose, then, a revision of Kant’s imperative for technologists: **do not work on something if you yourself do not want to live in the world where you are massively successful.**3 With this reframe, we turn the question of unicorn status on its head, and interrogate the ends instead of the means.
Should we become more empathetic, more equal, or more selfish? More creative, more free, or more distracted?


- ambitious yet humble - thoughtful yet action-oriented - diverse in interests yet focused/goal-driven - opinionated yet open-minded - confident yet vulnerable
vulnerability?

creative and eoathy 
- very intentional about what is the end goa that i would determine as psoitive
