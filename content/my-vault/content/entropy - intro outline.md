title: "entropy - intro outline"

forked from [[content/entropy - a newsletter]]
overall core of story 
- everything in modern life seems to be falling apart
	- while we build better and bigger construction projects  
		- as we move towards a more software-focused world 
		- we easily lose grip of the physical nature 
			- naturalized to expect 1-day shipping and on-demand zoom therapy 
			- our field of vision has become narrower as we expect software-level reliability/speed/performance out of infra-based reality
- infra is very different than software
	- the goal is to sustain and endure and to work around the clock 
	- its the very dna that co-evolves with behavioral patterns
		- eg city structure/housing affecting ppl's labor choices and quality of life
		- transportation and the day to day cruft / lost productivity
		- power lines that give us reliable internet 
- (insert this is fine meme)
- modernity means we're watching a car crash in slow motion 
	- examples: the mta relies on transformers that are on the brink of exploding
- -> in a bias to overoptimize for everything we have given systems no room to fail 
	- three tailwinds/harbringers of collapse:
		- life is getting more chaotic
			- eg natural disasters
			- eg more complexity in our systems -> more intersections/collision points -> more failure points 
				- as a corrolary more things depend on each other - so when one thing fails its more disastrous
					- butterfly effect - a fire in town X can cause ripple effects in industry Y 
					-  And thus when something goes wrong at point A, it quickly propagates at a cascading rate. 
					- overreliance on centralized hubs
					1. When one node fails, entire industries stall
		- efficiency accelerates entropy if it disallows friction/buffers/redundancy
			- system designed to run perfectly has no room to absorb shock 
			- when stress arrives collapse looks sudden but its been accumulating invisibly

- thesis: 
	- look at the case studies of infra in our life in the 
		- present
			- how they came to be, how they evolve, how they influence our every day decisions 
		- past 
			- why they failed
		- future 
			- what can we do ?

				- "There’s a great opportunity here related to urban technology. I personally believe that within our lifetime we will have to figure out how to rethink the way American settlements are made and how they operate. We have to rethink how we get our water, how we get our power, and how we store and transmit it. We have to rethink how we move, how we eat, how we govern ourselves. All of this is necessary because it’s clear that the design standards of the infrastructure we have did not contemplate the climate we are now living within. Much of our current infrastructure is too fragile or brittle to survive. Where is that reinvention going to happen?"
	- the people within it all
		- materiality of digital networks. In other words, systems that appear to exist in clouds and other immaterial spaces are always rooted in invisible yet very material infrastructures. For example, internet servers take up hundreds of squares of space and tasks like cleaning the internet of inappropriate content is typically accomplished not by algorithms but by workers in the Global South. We often discuss the sanitary or sustainable city, but how about the sanitary digital world? Is the invisibility of digital cleaners different from the invisibility of other types of maintainers? What is the emotional, physical and psychological toll that these workers experience? Turns out that clean streets as well as clean digital networks rely upon the invisible and displaced labor of marginalized peoples
	- general infra rabbit holes
		- I also want to investigate how technology in the context of urban development  -- such as apple pay on subway stations, last-mile bike apps for micro-mobility
- 
	- why me?
		- im a public transit nerd 
		- i like thinking in systems
		- i like choice theory 
			- video games are all about the ripple effects of a single action 
				- played life is strange etc fo
