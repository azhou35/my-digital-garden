title: "my point of view"
---

is something i want to cultivate and is informed by my past, my feelings in the present, and my aspirations for the future. 
i care strongly about the potential of technology as well as the technology of people. humans both frustrate and delight me needlessly - perhaps that's because i love them so much. 
i care strongly about multidisciplinary potential.
