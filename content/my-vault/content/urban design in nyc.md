- New City Critics aims to expand who writes about cities and shapes our public imagination. As legacy media shrinks and full-time critics disappear, there are fewer accessible, compelling stories interrogating how cities are made – and for whom. A small circle of voices dominates the existing conversation, with attention to limited topics and a narrow vision of what cities can be. We believe that to build better cities, we need a richer, more representative culture of criticism – one that expands who participates, what stories get told, and how we talk about design, power, and place
	- New City Critics aims to develop critical writing on urban design, development, and daily life that reflects the people who live in cities. We need more informed and sustained examination of citymaking in media beyond small professional circles and engaging varied publics. Housing, *workplaces*, infrastructure, public spaces, and monuments define the contours of our lives. 
- - We invite applications from early- to mid-career writers or urbanists deeply committed to making cities legible to broad audiences. Candidates should possess experience in both writing and urban practice, though we expect the balance to vary.
- - In addition, we welcome storytellers of varying ages and experiences – writers, journalists, designers, planners, scholars, advocates, artists, curators, organizers, DIY newsletter writers, zine publishers, podcasters, photo essayists, and others – who are committed to producing critical work about the shape and experience of our city.
