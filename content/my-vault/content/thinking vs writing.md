title: "thinking vs writing"
---

im someonewhos bad at holding abstract concepts in my head
i ALWAYs need to take notes 
- even when it comes to figuring out how to solve an engineering problem it takes me some time to document a plan
- i think thats why i need to think and collect my thoughts or even write down a response before i talk
