title: "fourth of july"
---

a place where fire can bloom and fall in the sky like rain. 

people drive from all over to see this - new jersey, north carolina. 

a family of italians, two grandmas and two grandsons, decked out in matching american flag gear. sequins for the ladies, gaudy button-ups for the lads. they ham it up with a neighbor in the first row, a rather overweight man who sags in his garden chair, a bit like the main character from *the whale* except if he was as happy as that man was sad. he tells the kids stories about the seven states he's travelled through and gives recs for the city (lombardi's, he claims, is the best italian.) the family buys him a beer. 

there's a forbidden zone, separating the "red" ticket buyers from the "blue" (a class distinction based on a a difference of 75$). the wife of the man, let's call her hankerchief lady for the accessory tying up her golden locks, is pressed to cross the chasm. she inches forward to the guard like a cat, batting her eyelashes for a chance to endear to his fellow sense of patriotism. he's amused but ignores her. 

there's music playing from a speaker. at times, country roads, miley cyrus, sweet home alabama. at the last one, this set of characters (who i've now imprinted on as if they were stars in a sitcom) gleefully perform their best efforts. at the chorus they break out into full out dance. the guys pumping at the sky, their collective voices into uproar. 

noticing my lingering eyes, my mom asks me if i have any like these folks. i laugh because she knows all my friends and who i get along with. we hold patriotism at an arm's length. cynicism is intellectual, or so we tell ourselves.

when ymca starts up the crowd goes feral, all the zumba moms standing up to splay their arms to the tune of the song. my mom joins in, though she doesn't quite know how to spell ymca. 

finally, it's the fireworks. i am needlessly mesmerized by pyrotechnics. i picture myself as the drone, the plane flying through the lights, the scientists who make the explosives, the designers choreographing the show. against the night sky how do you decide to paint it so? 

it's absurd, the things we humans can do. how many ways we've invented for striking the sky. there's a moment when the colorful lines disappearing leaving behind just white dots across the sky. *like stars,* i immediately recognize. *the only time manhattan will see stars.*

a girl points at the sky and says in mandarin, *wow, huo yu.*
