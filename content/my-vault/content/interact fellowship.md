Technical creation is an activity that is essential to humanity, available to all, and done by many.

Interact is a 501c3 technology fellowship founded in 2013. If you want to learn more you can search our twitter archives at @joininteract, or reach out to a fellow about their experience directly. Interact is very offline, but Interact fellows are not! The Fellowship admits technologists between the ages of 18 and 23, and considers applications from 24-year-olds on a case-by-case basis. The deadline to apply is August 23, 2024 at 11:59pm PT. We recommend procuring referrals from existing fellows where possible, but hold space in every class for applicants who don't have them. If you are curious to learn about Interact's Residency and other age-agnostic programs, reach out to team@joininteract.com and we'll share more. We appreciate the effort you've taken to make your way here. Wishing you the best of luck, in this application and beyond!
