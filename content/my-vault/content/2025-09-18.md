Ari Takata-Vasquez often wakes up in her bed not knowing where she is.

In May, she arose to what she believed to be the sound of an [Oakland police officer](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2024/oakland-police-chief-timeline/) blasting a message from a cruiser outside her downtown apartment and thought to herself, “They’re always doing too much.” But she wasn’t in Oakland. She was in [New York](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/workers-leave-sf-ny-19416170.php), hearing the loudspeaker announcements from the school across from her Brooklyn apartment.

Time zone dysphoria is just one of the quirks of bicoastal living.

Splitting her time between the two places, Takata-Vasquez is part of a larger, and growing, movement of younger workers dividing their time between California and New York.

“I go back and forth every three weeks — and it is a lot of traveling, but it’s really worth it for me,” said Hyungi Park, a tattoo and incense artist who’s been living bicoastally for over a year, between Los Angeles and New York. “It’s kind of a dream.”

To be sure, wealthy people who can afford multiple homes have been living on both American coasts for decades, but these folks don’t have the resources for that. They’re often freelance artists or creatives who run small businesses.

Since the pandemic, the number of people who live over 50 miles from their place of work has more than doubled, said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford and an expert on remote work — which Bloom said is here to stay. But this is something different — not just rich tech workers taking advantage of work-from-home options, but also creatives who feel tied to both places for careers and community. And more are following their example.

“I would like to stay in New York for six months at a time and then come back to the Bay,” said Chelsea Calalay, 30, an Oakland jeweler who’s actively looking to sublet in New York for next year. “I feel like I have to chase where my customers are.”

Still, it’s not an easy commute.

With a distance of around 2,500 miles between them, two of the most expensive real estate markets in the world and one-way tickets that are often hundreds of dollars, California and New York are tough places to split your time.

But Park, 29, who was born in Texas and raised in North Carolina, has found a setup that works for her: She lives and works in the two places, but she only pays for housing in one. Her partner pays for their Brooklyn apartment, while Park has a home in the Tujunga neighborhood of Los Angeles, which has a storefront for her wares and tattooing in the front.

Takata-Vasquez, 34, a muralist who owns the design company Viscera Studio and grew up in Hawaii, has spent springs and falls at her apartment in Brooklyn and summers and winters at her apartment in Oakland for the last three years. 

“I just sublet where I’m not,” she said, adding that having apartments in two of the most in-demand realty markets means she can usually find tenants.

To her point, in the last year, membership to the home-swapping platform Kindred has grown by a factor of seven to 150,000 people across North America and Europe, said founder and San Francisco resident Justine Palefsky.

“New York City is our most popular city, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles,” said Palefsky, who noticed that a significant part of Kindred’s membership are artists. “And the No. 1 most requested route is L.A. to New York, as well as New York to San Francisco.”

Electronic musician and composer Amma Ateria, 42, who grew up in Hong Kong and New York, has been living bicoastally since the pandemic by splitting time between her brother’s place in San Francisco, a friend’s home in Albany, Calif., and her aunt’s place in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn. The lifestyle is not without its challenges, she said.

“I hate packing so much that I start crying because I’m so sleep-deprived,” Ateria said. “Trying to sustain those two lives is quite difficult, but I’m trying to do it gracefully.”

In spite of the long travel hours, costs and time zone disorientation, all three artists don’t want to give up either coast. In fact, they say they need each place to sustain themselves professionally and emotionally.

In late May, Ateria had returned to San Francisco after an immersive tea ceremony performance in New York that necessitated long rehearsal and performance hours. She said the Bay Area is where she can rest, be a homebody and hunker down with her music. But New York has most of the venues that support her career. It’s also where she feels more challenged, creatively.

“I definitely have to go inward a lot, and I need a lot of sunlight,” she said. “I think because I studied music here (in the Bay Area), I’ve always had a sense of discipline and polishing things here — and then New York is where I share them.”

Despite moving with the seasons, Takata-Vasquez still feels connected to her communities on both coasts, where she’s also been cultivating networks for her work as a designer.

“My dad’s originally from New York, and whenever I come here I feel closer to the Black Puerto Rican side of my family,” she said. “I’ve also lived in the Bay for 17 years, and I feel a lot of kinship between Oakland and Brooklyn.”

Living in two places may sound as glamorous as it is difficult, but Park, who has customer bases and industry connections on both coasts, said the opposite is true: It’s less glamorous but more doable than people might think, thanks to the rise of apartment swapping and airline mileage deals through credit cards. By May, she’d already taken 12 flights between New York and L.A. this year, during which she mostly worked on her laptop.

“People always ask me, ‘New York or L.A.?’” she said. “And I’m like, ‘They’re so different that you really can’t pick, and the beauty of bicoastal is that they balance each other.’”

In the relative quiet and spaciousness of her Los Angeles neighborhood, Park is more focused and relaxed. But in New York, there’s a spontaneity and chaos she loves.

“I really get the best of both worlds,” she said. “And honestly, I think I’m going to try to hold onto being bicoastal for as long as possible.”

Besides the Schrödinger’s cat-esque experience of waking up in one of two places, there’s another odd quirk to being bicoastal: doubles of everyday objects.

Park, for instance, has identical teapots sitting some 2,500 miles apart. They’re both round like clay moons, left-handed like Park and consistent parts of her morning ritual, which begins with a sip of milky oolong or Japanese green tea.

In May, Park’s New York teapot slipped out of her hand and shattered in the kitchen sink, breaking the symmetry of her twin lives. She’ll order another one soon.
