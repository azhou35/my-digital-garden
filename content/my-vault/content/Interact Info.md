Core Beliefs
Technology is not an industry; it's a discipline that's changing every industry.
People don't do great things alone—progress is achieved together.
In order to better the world, we must also better ourselves.
Interact was founded in 2012. Every year since, new Fellows have been welcomed into Interact, which is voluntarily organized and led by former Fellows.

Over its history, Interacters have built friendships, co-founded ventures, and supported one another in achieving their missions. We share an enthusiasm for making intentional impact and find joy in thoughtful conversations. As the fellowship has grown, one thing has stayed constant: our earnest commitment to making our world better.

### What Do People Produce

	- We were driven by the realization that technologists hold an increasingly important position in society, with the capability to change billions of peoples' life experiences through the tools they build. But the set of ideologies or life-philosophies currently on offer to most people pursuing a career in technology are surprisingly shallow, as is many technologists' understanding of their field's history.
	- This is one small step towards something different: an ethic that prioritizes technologists' agency, the need for self-reflection, and the importance of historical inquiry.
	- We started out as an Interact Circle (part of an Interact grants program for creative projects), and held weekly meeting centered around connecting with each other and discussing ideas — and, crucially, having a lot of fun. We read books, essays and papers, debated myriad aspects of technology, technological "culture", and Silicon Valley, disagreed with and learned from each other. We capped our time together off by spending a weekend together writing up our essays.
