title: "intentions for outtakes from street"
---

- a series recounting my photography process & philosophy. i launched my substack in tandem with my photography account and this is no mistake - they're both a reflection of how i see the world. the details i fixate on & what colors my point of view.
- i have many street photo idols 
- many film theorists i look up to
- and ofc the prose writers i enjoy
- lets pull in inspo from these sources and write from heart
