Annie has a solid mix of AI infra experience and legal domain knowledge that fits what we’re looking for. She’s currently  OpenAI’s supercomputing stuff at Microsoft, helping bring their latest GB200s online, and before that was the first PM at a legal tech startup working on contract redlining. She’s shipped AI copilots in healthcare and finance, so she gets the compliance side of working with regulated industries. Annie is looking to switch to a startup to have a more grounded and real world impact on customers through cutting edge AI applications like Harvey.

Annie's currently a TPM at Microsoft managing supercomputing infrastructure for OpenAI's training workloads, which gives her direct experience with the kind of large-scale AI systems Harvey runs on. She's led customer deployments of copilot tools in healthcare and finance—two industries that are just as paranoid about compliance as legal, so she knows how to ship AI products that actually pass regulatory scrutiny. Her stint as the first PM at a legal tech startup means she gets the specific pain points of building for lawyers and understands what it takes to get legal professionals to trust and adopt new technology. With her data science chops and track record of keeping complex technical projects on track, she'd be a solid addition to Harvey's team.
