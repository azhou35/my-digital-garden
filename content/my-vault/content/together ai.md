# Email to Niki at Together AI


**Subject: Together AI PM roles - connecting from Microsoft Azure AI**

Hey Niki!

I'm Annie, a TPM at Microsoft Azure working on supercomputing infrastructure for AI customers like OpenAI. Reaching out because Together AI's work on democratizing AI access really caught my attention. 

I discovered Together through my research work at Contrary (did a deep dive here: https://research.contrary.com/company/together-ai) and through my sister, an AI professor who uses Together for her social science research. She's had nothing but positive experiences on your platform - something she can't say the same when using Azure to fine-tune LLMs. Altogether, I've been really impressed by your approach to making powerful AI infrastructure accessible.

In my current role, I see firsthand the challenges of scaling AI infrastructure and the barriers many researchers face. At the same time, my previous experiences in early product development at startups and thinking through compute needs has elucidated my desire to work in a smaller company. 

I saw you're looking for PM/TPM roles and would love to learn more about your vision for Together's product roadmap! Would you be open to a quick chat in the coming weeks?

Cheers, 
Annie

Hey Niki!

I discovered Together through my Contrary research (deep dive: https://research.contrary.com/company/together-ai) and through my sister, an AI professor who uses Together for social science research. Her positive experiences with your platform - especially compared to the challenges she faced fine-tuning LLMs on Azure - highlight why your approach to accessible AI infrastructure is so compelling.

While my role at Microsoft has shown me the challenges of scaling AI systems, my previous startup experience has clarified my desire to apply these insights at a smaller, more nimble company like Together.

I saw the team is hiring across PM/TPM roles -  would love to learn more about your experience at Together and vision for the product roadmap! Are you open to a quick chat in the coming weeks?

Cheers,
