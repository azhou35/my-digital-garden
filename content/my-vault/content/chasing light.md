title: "chasing light"
---

it is november and the day slips away by 5PM. on the way back from a hike we scramble to grab our cameras and catch the last of sunday light. driving a rental down the street of an abandoned small town. and i feel alive. 

i take every trip upstate with a side of mirth, bemused that i'd revisit the subject of my dissent that plagued my college years.

photographing pretty places is easy. i was never one for glory shots, landscapes and the like. it becomes way more satisfying to capture life
