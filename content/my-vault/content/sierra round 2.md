Tell me about yourself. 

Why Sierra? 
Resonate with the mission and how they sell outcomes and not tools - explain how current job is literally maintaining GPUs and how every second of downtime is an impact on your bottom line, you pay OpenAI back. Now that’s a particularly absolutist arrangement but that’s how selling to enterprises SHOULD work. Pricing based on outcomes and resolutions aligns incentives all the way around and i first heard this on a podcast with Bret a few months ago and that just immediately clicked with me as this ethos around how the company is built. I grew up around family running small businesses across New Jersey. I can’t tell you how many times my uncle told me some version of the “customer is always right” adage but he knew every regular by name, made every person feel valued and happy leaving the shop. It’s not just something I grew up with but just feels intuitive to me. Customer service is the number one way enterprises can ensure retention and just given, how I myself take my dollars to whoever treats me the best, e.g. I churned off my Chase card after I consistently found it difficult to do things on my account. Now I can’t imagine the cost businesses bear when someone who’s actually economically valuable, unlike me, churns. Alice told me about Sierra’s push towards regulated industries like financial services and healthcare, where people are already constantly on edge and the margin for error doesn’t exist - If agents can assist and give people that same feeling of happiness my uncle gave people with these interactions, that’s something I want to work towards. Finally, I deeply care about talent density and at this stage in my career, I really want to optimize around being a sponge and learning as much as I can from people around me. Obviously Bret and Clay are renowned in the tech world, but to me it comes down to seeing people in more mid level roles like my friend Saagar who are just ambitious, driven to make an impact, and mission aligned from day 1. Surrounding myself with a large, in person team right before that super inflection point is really important for me and my career. Why this role? Desperately want to be customer facing. From my experience from Copilot, knew that working with these genomics researchers were deeply valuable because I was enabling people to do their life’s work properly. And then I got the complete opposite end of the spectrum with my next deployment at Microsoft where I spend 3-4 hours a day talking to OpenAI devs, who are demanding to say the least. Constantly being in that pressure cooker type environment was super valuable for me because it taught me the value of being multi-disciplinary. I had to interface with devs on both ends, shuffle and manage disparate teams with different incentive structures, and then also get my hands dirty with cleaning data, managing and building dashboards, etc. I want to properly build off that experience and that’s why this role stood out to me. On a more macro and zoomed out view, I’ve started to build conviction that my edge is thriving in ambiguity in these forward deployed scenarios and this role offers a bit of everything: product sense and customization, building with the engineers, managing customers and being the face of the agent. Obviously, I started off my career in a product role and at some point in the future, I do want to return to a core product type role and build my capabilities there but I believe at my core that the product function doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Without constant learning from customers (and often you play messenger within orgs) and being the person who is interfacing with them, it’s tough to properly tune my product sense for whatever I’m building. Borrowing off the Karp analogy on Michelin star staff, I want to be a waiter, be front of house, chop ingredients, and not many companies offer that amalgam in a job. 


**Questions for Andrew: Went through your profile, you’ve obviously been very senior at a number of venture backed companies and larger corporations, what differentiates Sierra to you?** 


From a customer facing perspective, what today is Sierra’s primary selling point? 

- **From a customer-facing perspective, what is Sierra’s primary selling point today?**  
    → Is it the reliability of their **multi-agent orchestration framework**, the ability to maintain **brand-aligned agent personas**, or the trust built through **robust guardrail systems**?
    
- **Competitive dynamics:** With **Fin** and **Decagon** raising heavily to land-grab in this space, how does Sierra differentiate in terms of **agent grounding, orchestration quality, and human-in-the-loop workflows**?
    
- **Talent lens:** In your mind, what is the ideal skillset or gap today? For instance, is Sierra looking for operators who can design **safe escalation pathways**, tune **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines**, or drive enterprise adoption through **agent governance and compliance frameworks**?
    
- **Human-in-the-loop maturity:** From my time at Microsoft and experimenting with agents personally, much of this tech is still **finicky** — brittle in tool use and prone to hallucination. How does Sierra operationalize the **human-in-the-loop feedback loop** both at the product level (agent evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback) and at the customer experience level (handoffs, agent-as-copilot, confidence scoring)?
Know Fin and Decagon are also raising a good bit of money to try to land grab in this market, so curious to your view In your mind, what is the ideal skillset or what do you think are gaps at the company today that a new set of candidates would fill? 

As I spend time within Microsoft and on my own playing around with agents, the truth is, a lot of it is still finicky and far from perfect - how does Sierra manage the human-in-the-loop aspect of both the product and customer experience? 

Take a case study - see chime and mercury and ramp on customer list which all have sensitive data obviously, what does the initial scoping, onboarding, and rollout process work? (FILL IN MORE JARGON HERE FROM YOUR T-MOBILE CASE STUDY TO MAKE YOU STAND OUT WITH THIS Q)


Questions 
1.    Understanding and probing the “outcome-based” pricing model — What does “successful resolution” mean, and how is that quantified? How is performance measured and disputed?      2.    Sierra’s technical stack and integration strategy — What models are they using? How do they handle retrieval-augmented generation, guardrails, audit logs, compliance, and human fallback? What are their strategies for minimizing hallucinations?      3.    Agent design trade-offs — How do they think about agent autonomy vs safety? What types of guardrails or supervisor agents are in place or planned?      4.    Enterprise deployment challenges — How do they handle edge cases, system failures, integration with legacy CRMs or order systems, and privacy/regulatory compliance?      5.    Competitive differentiation — How does Sierra compete with legacy chatbot providers, other AI automation vendors, or companies building their own in-house agents? What is Sierra’s edge?      6.    Scalability and global rollout — What are the key risks and go-to-market considerations for deploying Sierra agents internationally or in regulated markets like healthcare or finance?      7.    Metrics and success criteria — What KPIs does Sierra focus on for its internal teams and enterprise customers? How do they benchmark satisfaction, resolution quality, or ROI?
