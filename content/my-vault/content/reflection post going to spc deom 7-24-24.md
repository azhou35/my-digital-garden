**important: now what?**
* the friction behind creating something is lower than ever
* what we need is CREATIVITY
* lots of interfaces to play with 
* how can we push the meaning of a computer / ai / llm? 
so glad i had an sheperd me around
what is something as low friction as scrolling idk
1. websim.ai
2. makec
Spc park demos 
1. Ink and switch: version control but for ai collaboration 
2. websim.ai — platform for ppl to create softwares (abstract away calling gen ai themselves i guess)
3. NYU itp professor: small software
4. Linus: ai as synthesizer — distill things down to first principles and see what concepts you pull out (eg colors, sounds), figma demo of how you can input text and it collects a bunch of docs related to
	5. [Prism: mapping interpretable concepts and features in a latent space of language | thesephist.com](https://thesephist.com/posts/prism/)
5. Tldraw — create upon the dom.. literally draw what you want to see — cool analogy of we started everything w text -> something visual / pointing related (eg typing on computer -> mouse, typing on a blackbery keyboard -> swiping on phone)
6. Also girl boss figma demo (mihika kapoor) 

at night: i woke up at 2am with a literal and metaphorical itch -- like what am i doing here doing middle management work like this??

My remaining question is out of all these experiments what is the next step?

Patchwork 
Good creative software has version control

Ai could directly edit collaborative data layer
Tldraw 
Edits software within the softeware

Small software
Cheap 
Trust
Less adverse incentives 
Map of where we travelled
From body 

Websim

Recollect ai

Using ai is the pre skill 
Use ai to teach ppl how to use ai

Language models can take any input and see all the ideas a model sees 

Explain why a document is related to the the input 
Algorithm looking at both models and decomposing 
Select a concept but what documents talk about concept 

Build a heat map 
Assign some things red and orange
What documents align with these things
See not only individual node but also data visualizations
Aka related to time 
Scatter plot : strong statistical correlation 
Diff ways of looking at ur entire library 
Pivoting around certain ideas

Everything is super creative and thinking about things in the abstract
