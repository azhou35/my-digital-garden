title: "systems design"
---

It's important for our TPMs to have a level of technical depth
to understand the nuances of what’s going on, how technical
systems are connected, and to use that technical knowledge
to foresee the consequences of subtle but significant
engineering tradeoffs.
To assess this, we'd like you to explain a technical system as
if you are telling a new engineering colleague how it worked.
Be prepared to describe the high-level engineering
architecture of a technical system you're familiar with.
You choose the system you’ll describe. We leave this choice
to you because while we do not expect every TPM to know
how to "Architect Slack" or "Architect Twitter," we do expect
TPMs to gain the technical expertise required to tackle
systems they're supporting.
This is a live conversation with an engineer. You'll have 40
minutes to describe the system and answer follow up
questions about it. The final 5 minutes are for more general
Q&A.

Please prepare slides to help guide the conversation.
Agenda suggestions:
● Briefly introduce What the system is doing and Why it
needed to exist.
● Spend most of the time on the How.
● Describe the technical scale requirements this system
was designed to handle.
● Discuss engineering tradeoffs that were made in the
design of this system.
● Discuss problematic and improvement areas that
needed to be prioritized.
● Be prepared to answer ad-hoc clarifying questions by
the engineer. It's okay to say "I don't know."
