Scripps, May 

When I am inside writing,  
all I can think about is how I should be outside living.

When I am outside living,  
all I can do is notice all there is to write about.

When I read about love, I think I should be out loving.  
When I love, I think I need to read more.

I am stumbling in pursuit of grace,  
I hunt patience with a vengeance.

On the mornings when my brother’s tired muscles  
held to the pillow, my father used to tell him,

_For every moment you aren’t playing basketball,_  
_someone else is on the court practicing._

I spend most of my time wondering  
if I should be somewhere else.

So instead, I have learned to shape the words thank you  
with my first breath each morning, my last breath every night.

When the last breath comes, at least I will know I was grateful  
for all the places I was so sure I was not supposed to be.

All those places I made it to,  
all the loves I held, all the words I wrote.

And even if it is just for one moment,  
I know I will be exactly where I am supposed to be.
