[SEAH STUDIO](https://seah.studio/) 

 I spend my days working as a product marketer on **YouTube's Music & Premium** team, focused on building and launching innovative global features. My work has been highlighted in TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired, Variety, Billboard and.
  
I spend my evenings exploring new ideas around **creative tools**, and late nights designing my heart out. I’m incredibly passionate about **centering artists and creatives** in all that I do, from collaborating with Grammy award winning musicians to emerging designers. I host **[monthly events](https://mseah.com/Creative)** that unite the creative community and provide a space to share early stage experiments.  
  
I started my career in early stage consumer startups, ranging from the worlds of **[VR](https://mseah.com/Mindshow)** to **[coworking](https://mseah.com/WeWork)** to **[DTC](https://mseah.com/Italic)**. I’ve built many initiatives of my own, from a **[nonprofit](https://mseah.com/Run-Without-Boundaries)** to startups tackling **[community spaces](https://mseah.com/High-Table)** and new paradigms for **[search & discovery](https://mseah.com/Re-Search)**. I’m passionate about fundraising for local causes, raising over $200,000 for impactful organizations.  
  
I’m based in **San Francisco**, by way of Los Angeles, Shanghai and Bangkok.

I think a lot about information representations, human-computer interfaces, embodied cognition, and the nature of thought.

Although my background is in physics, math, and computer science, I consider interface design to be my primary specialty. I also love storytelling, creative tools, and contemplating how the mediums we use shape us.

Currently, I'm spending my time on a new startup building at the intersection of AI and Cinema.

advice from

[@ArfurRock](https://x.com/ArfurRock)

on building your life's work - be undeniable in everything that you do. instead of aiming for 'excellence', which has many levels, focus on meeting & maximizing your full potential, so you know that you gave it your all when looking back. the extra effort pays off

creative experimentation — exploring the future of art, curation & culture
ive neve had any desire to move to sf until now 


I sometimes describe myself as [a technology optimist](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779036) who thinks and prepares like a pessimist. The only way to decrease ethical debt is to take the time to think ahead about things that might go wrong – but this is not something that technologists are necessarily [taught to do](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15536.pdf).

[Scientist and iconic science fiction writer Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov) once said that sci-fi authors “foresee the inevitable, and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable, solutions are not.” Of course, science fiction writers do not tend to be tasked with developing these solutions – but right now, the technologists developing AI are.

So how can AI designers learn to think more like science fiction writers? [One of my current research projects](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/2021/04/09/intervention-how-ethical-speculation-could-prevent-future-tech-trouble) focuses on developing ways to support this process of ethical speculation. I don’t mean designing with far-off robot wars in mind; I mean the ability to consider future consequences at all, including in the very near future.
