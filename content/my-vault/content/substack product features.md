substack
	- > One of my favorite products is **Substack**. I use it regularly to write and read newsletters — it’s my go-to place for long-form thinking. I love how easy it is to publish and how direct the relationship is between writer and reader.
	- That said, there are a few areas I’d improve:
> 
	> **1. Discoverability**: It’s still hard to _find_ new writers unless you’re already in someone’s circle. I’d love to see a better topic-based feed or more smart recommendations to surface up-and-coming voices.
	> 
	> **2. Observability**: As a writer, the analytics are pretty limited. You see open rates and subscriptions, but it’s hard to understand _why_ something performed well or how people found it. Adding more referral insights or cohort breakdowns could help writers grow smarter.
	> 
	> **3. Retention**: As a reader, I sometimes forget to come back unless something lands in my inbox. Substack could experiment with better in-app experiences, like weekly roundups or mobile-friendly feeds, to make it more sticky beyond email.
	> 
	> Overall, I think Substack is great at empowering writers — and with a few tweaks, it could be just as strong at growing and retaining audiences too.
### 🔍 1. Discoverability

**User pain:** Hard to find new, relevant writers unless you're already in the loop.

**Solution directions:**

- **Interest-based onboarding**: When a reader signs up, ask them to pick topics they care about → seed a personalized feed.
    
- **“If you liked this...” suggestions**: After finishing a post, recommend 2–3 similar Substacks, powered by tags or reader behavior.
### 📊 2. Observability

**User pain:** Writers don’t have enough insight into what’s working or how readers are finding them.

**Solution directions:**

- **Source breakdowns**: Add simple referral tags — did a subscriber come from Twitter, another Substack, search, etc.?
    
- **Post heatmaps**: Show which sections of a post were most read or clicked (optional for readers).
### 🔁 3. Retention

**User pain:** Readers forget to check Substack unless prompted by email.

**Solution directions:**

- **Weekly personalized digest**: “Here’s what you missed from writers you follow.”
    
- **Push notification opt-in for mobile**: Let users get alerts when favorite writers post.
    
- **Reading streaks / light gamification**: Subtle reminders like “You've read 3 days in a row!”
