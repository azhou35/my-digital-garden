title: "thoughts on nitin post trip"
---

* we said i love you bc he had been thinking about when to say it 
* but im afraid of clearing the air and making the first move so i was waiting for him to say it 
* i think i genuinely think he is critical of most ppl and things and i want him to be protective of me
* im a little scared bc if he sees me as his equal he will understand i cant keep up with what hes sayin
* post molly i was very certain i loved him bc i feel like he understands me in a way better than i understand myself
	* post trip im skeptical bc theres actually nothing to me to understand
	* i still appreciate how much he tried to understand my situation
	* and i think a lot of our situation is me trying to articulate how im feeling and him trying to piece it together and paint a story that i can latch onto
