1. **Plaza Use Patterns**: Most plazas are underutilized, serving primarily as walkways, with social activity concentrated in select sociable spaces.
    
2. **Demographics and Signals**: Young office workers dominate plaza use, with a higher presence of women indicating a plaza's sociability and appeal.
    
3. **Human Behavior in Space**:
    
    - People gravitate toward crowds and edges (e.g., pillars), avoiding open central areas.
    - Social interactions cluster near traffic lines, not isolated zones.
4. **Universal Urban Patterns**: Movement and interaction behaviors in plazas are consistent across societies, reflecting findings like Jan Gehl’s self-congestion studies.
    
5. **Urban Design Principles**:
    
    - Blend streets and parks for seamless public space.
    - Parks should balance openness and enclosure to feel safe and inviting.
6. **Social Stimuli**: Triangulation through features like sculptures fosters spontaneous interactions by connecting people through shared experiences.
