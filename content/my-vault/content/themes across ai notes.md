[[ai translation and human connection]]
[[attention is all you need]]
[[bids for attention]]

* AI's improving attention mechanisms 
	* vs humans' potentially degrading attention capabilities
* Infrastructure vs humanity
* Cultural / linguistic gaps -> translationan and cultural understanding
You seem particularly interested in the gaps between AI's technical capabilities and human needs, especially in areas requiring deep cultural understanding, empathy, and nuanced communication. Your notes suggest a search for ways to bridge these gaps while maintaining human connection and ensuring ethical deployment of AI systems.

> **2. AI as Personal Assistant for Relationships**

An AI could piece together a living map of your relationships by accessing your contacts, social media, and calendar. After hanging out with a friend or meeting with your coworker, you'd share quick updates about how things went via journaling or voice-over. At first, this might seem too similar to just any other personal CRM, but over time the AI magic would kick in. Imagine being nudged to seek out introductions with people that you weren’t aware of, challenged in how you show up in certain dynamics, or to be reminded of past interactions before meetings. Rather than replacing relationships, this would amplify them using AI’s unforgettable memory and infinite brainpower to guide us towards healthier, more human relationships.
