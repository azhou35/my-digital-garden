title: "create-tober"

[[creative intertia]]
every year, the visual artist community organizes the challenge "inktober," where participants draw according to a prompt every day for the month of october. in 2020 i followed this format with digital doodles -- in 2022 i challenged myself to write a poem every day. following this two-year cadence, i want to challenge myself to create *something*, every day in october. throughout high school i did writing challenges as well: blog-a-day for april, 10k words for NaNoWriMo. 

this year, i'm holding myself accountable to a similar challenge. the constraints are minimal. it is impossible to choose a hobby -- between prose-writing, photography, poetry, drawing -- so this year, i want to hop between them all. i'm going to forgo the prompts -- they've gotten a bit stale after so many iterations. all that matters is that every day, i prioritize creating **something**. 

as a self-termed multimedia ~ creative ~, i often take a step back from all my interests and try to find the common thread. creativity feels like a force, some sort of momentum that can be transferred from one piece of an art to another. that's why when i write something, i get inspired to draw -- when i look at a painting in a museum, i'm inspired to write -- when i watch a movie, i want to go on a photoshoot. maybe it's because the themes i fixate on are so universal, almost basic. but there's nothing more inspiring than seeing the work of my own creative friends: their momentum drives me to create. 

in the past i've documented my progress on daily instagram updates (priv igs, so truly shouting into the void). this month, i plan to post every day on substack, with whatever drawing/writing/photo/creative output i come up with. (NB: for these posts i'll turn off the email notif, so i won't spam my lovely subscribers :'))

creating in public will keep me accountable and also lower the pressure of posting on substack -- many of these creative outputs will be unpolished, but i want to reward frequent drafts as a way to build this habit. (part of me secretly hopes my other fellow friends will join me on this challenge -- i can imagine @bahar working on music every day, or @connie making a doodle, or @justin writing up his thoughts on community).

when i look back at previous iterations of this challenge, i normally don't end up with anything i could proudly send to a lit mag or publish on my own. i imagine myself working on a little baby piece on the subway commute, or in between meetings, or right before bed. my goals are loosely:
* develop a habit of drawing / writing 
* spend less time on doom scrolling apps
* spend more time observing what's around me
* try posting on substack from my phone (it's a feature i don't think i would use except for something casual like this)
* come up with a better name than create-tober (lmk if you have any thoughts !)
* inspire at least one person to create one thing!!
