 **I wonder if part of growing up is realizing adult pleasures are just the ones mixed in with pain.**
 drinking in the summer
something about unrequited love 
Everyday the same dream
every unbashed joy has a caveat. 

exploring cocktail culture. as your senses dull in adulthood we like the taste of coffee. i wake in search of the acrid bean taste and yearn for the bitter sharpness of alcohol. 
sweetness slips away too soon. it's bitterness that lingers on the tongue. 

bitter lingers on the tongue, like the memory stretches across years. 
perhaps growing up is realizing adult pleasures are just the ones mixed in with pain
