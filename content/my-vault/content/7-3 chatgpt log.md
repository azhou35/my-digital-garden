Trying to unpack my problem domains: themes of **interpretability, democratizing thought, aesthetics, community, authenticity**

1. **Urbanism and Memory** “How do we design urban spaces that preserve collective memory, authenticity, and cultural gravity?”
	1. how would we design infra that accounts for non-economic value 
	2. can we prototype a civic time capsule 
	3. what would a tool look like that maps "emotional infra" of a city

2. **Data Interpretability** “How do we make data legible across a system — for humans, across roles, and across time?”
	1. Provenance tracking in LLMs
	2. Larger question off debugging orgs / data /infra, how to build cognitive tools to navigate complexity, how to trace causes of failure across interdependent systems
3. **Language, time,  drift**:_“How do we track and preserve how language — and thought — shifts over time?”_
	1. Digital humanities
	2. Can language preservation tools become a part of end of life care or elderhood rituals
4. **AI x Science Bottleneck problem** *how do we use AI to shorten the time from insight*

Drift problem - how do you design for systems that constantly evolve 
	like language drift, model and data drift, social norms
