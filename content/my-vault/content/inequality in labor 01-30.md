ppl focus about the inequality in AI 

**inequality in AI usage**
how is ai diffusing in the workplace? whos actually using it? 

but there are more nuanced versions of inequality
- worker productivity 
	- excel 
construction economy is booming (but its not)
- u put make up on the pig - hides the underlying decay in society
- DC buildout is so high 

technology is also the root of inequality 
technology raises the floor and widens the gap 
e.g.:
- the rise of the cotton picking machine / steam engine 
- the factory creates the daily wage labor
- entrenched that some ppl have skills 
- the rise of the internet have lifted out of poverty 

last inflection point: 
- industrial revolution
maintenance is all u need? 
- e.g. steampunk maintaining
karpathy:
- humans have a good way of organizing ourselves and 
- 1) creating value where isnt 
- 2) creating new jobs
e.g. industrial revolution wiped out jobs, and then created way NEW jobs
- e.g. prof services economy
- US created a new class of workers
- takes 50-60 yrs




everyone gets access to ai 
- how do we democratize access to ai. how do we raise the floor 
as we become tik tok ified / cant read articles, agents can have the more focus 

i run 3 claude code terminals at once and dont pay attention 

**ari emanuel**
the amount of experiences that go up
more people who want to go to real world expeirences
real world economy 
-popups 
the anti ai bet: 
as ai makes dig content cheaper and every day work more automated the value will accrue in everyday

what will those experiences be?
- ai match making 
	- ai that encourages u to meet ppl
	- ai to find real world connectoins

how does this work:
- do we do the rate limits on our side
- enforce the rate limits but wil give the flexibility to repeat whatever they want
- microsoft should enforce the rate limits
