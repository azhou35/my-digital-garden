title: "i think about the last time"
---

i was in love. there are pictures of me, staring at eric, washed with a desire that i would do anything for him. the way my heart would lift at a text from him, 

i wonder if he's still a mental blocker, after all this time. the memory of him is so strong. 
at the end of the day im still hurt.
he was an awful person and im still hurt
