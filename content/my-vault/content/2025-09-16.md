saagar p role

- rlly excited about the role
- theres just a couple things im thinking thru and 
- in a way i really resepct the way you think about things
- kenny framed it as working very closely with you 
	- want to hear what ur ideal tpm role is
	- day to day is extremeley diff than microsoft 
	- ive seen a lot of tpms churn 

- transparently im also considering two other startups 
	- and the main thing holding me back is just the location aspect
	- ive talked to kenny about this and was aligned w sf 
	- but somethings panned out w my parents where i have to take care of them 
	- also wanted to hear what ur vibe is like 
- i have a really awesome job at microsoft and im willing to leave that job to take this job
	- here are my reservations and concerns
	- what do tpms do 
		- it sounds like the work you do is very pm like
- 
- im very excited and also a bit cautious about the opportunity here 
- gneerally i index on whats goin to make impact and also whats going to be best for my family 
ask him what this relationship looks like

big decision for him
