title: "on the train ride from nj to new york"

the windows are dusty and smudged, tinted the same way my neglected glasses are
we pass by junkyards piled high with garbage, tendrils of smoke billowing against sky
i imagine myself looking at a film roll and speed running thru a movie set - 2D motion only 
stiff tuffts of cattails 
rickety brittle trees 
parking lots upon parking lots 
culdesca upon culdesac
i remember one time my west coast friends and i drove into jersey to check out the largest hindu temple the world. *why does it look.. so colonial?*
