- i am interested in interfaces bc of the same reason i am interested in authenticity + individualism - 
- i think every product has a very unique value prop and inner core sense
- and the ability of the interface to convey the affordances tat suggest potential use cases of the product relies on a balance of storytelling, candor, and efficacy
-  friction is a lever of timing in order to control the user interface
- buttons + interface features like modal popups are ways to abstract certain actions 
- disclose information with hierarchy
- abstract by finding patterns and relationships
- Design representations that are both accurate and evocative
- aesthetic coherence
- The most beautiful interfaces for complex systems often feel like well-designed maps—they orient users, suggest paths, reveal landmarks, but ultimately empower exploration rather than dictating a single route.
