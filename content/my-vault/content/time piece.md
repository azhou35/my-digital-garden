Jackson Dahl:
> which is time. And you've been asked about time plenty, but you've said you're on a mission to change our relationship to time. There were a couple of quotes from I think maybe an Ssense interview that I really liked. Taylor, you had said, "Time is our common ground no matter who you are, how much money you have, where you live, what culture you have. All of us humans have time in common. Being on time for somebody is a way of respecting another person. It's a way to connect with the rest of the world that's respectful. There are not always easy opportunities to do that. Sharing time with someone is such a gift." And then Che-Wei, you had said, "It's as close to a universal language that we have. It isn't totally universal. There are people on different calendars, but it's very close."

inverting timekeeping:
>The kind of "I don't want to have clocks in my life" feeling kind of flipped 180 and I was like, no, actually I want to be super precise with understanding what time is. This language that we all share, however arbitrary it is, it is linked to the way our solar system works. We divide it in an arbitrary increment, but we share it as a common language. And the perspective I had then, which I think I still follow, is that we, a lot of our anxiety or the pressure we feel around time comes from a mismatch of what we think is a time increment versus what it actually is.

>how do you gain a closer, more intimate relationship with timekeeping so that you can live your time in a less anxious world.

? Like we obviously know the closer you get to mass, the more time dilates and when you're a kid you've experienced less

> Isn’t it ironic that, of all things, it’s our time machines that are stuck in the past?

[Diego Báez — Inheritance | The On Being Project](https://onbeing.org/programs/diego-baez-inheritance/)
>Many people say their experience of time changes after they have children, a phenomenon that Diego Báez captures in “Inheritance.” In this poem, a past, present, and future starring the same child shift ceaselessly in a parent’s mind, like photos flipped through in an album, dots placed on a timeline, moments that one wishes they could build monuments for.

> from interstellar: time dilation can drastically affect the perception of time for those in a strong gravitational field compared to those in a weaker field 
> when you are in a stronger gravitaional field time is *slower *
> boredom vs flow state 


sometimes i just dont keep track of time

time dilation - time feels slowest at the beginnings and endings of our lives
at your youngest: with only few years accumulated, each year matters more
at your oldest: with only a few years left, you hold onto every minute
the truth is im terrified of outliving my parents.
every year is taking the math to its final end - when im 30 theyll be 68. when im 35 theyll be 73. 
it already aches when they walk, their bodies already frail. 
a child's experience of time upturns when they realize how old their parents are.
