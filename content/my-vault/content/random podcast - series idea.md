"the third door"
- in response to new grads feeling like theyre locked into their current role, who started in industry and found their third door?
	- who's pursuing their passions in art -- writing, music, creativity
	- passions in entrepreneurship -- startups
	- in community building -- adult clubs
	- in content -- content creation 
substack on the third door

the dangers of pattern-matching 
vc is just a pattern matching game - but the ppl who win subvert trends
