Salon: *How is technology affecting our humanity?*

Sci-fi story ideas:
1. [[ai translation and human connection]]
2. "Emotional Rollback" 
	1. Idea that our states are preserved within github-like instances, and we can "rollback" to a state preceeding a checkpoint
	2. Someone wants to forget an uncomfortable breakup and rolls back
	3. what if u tried to roll back ur last iteration pre breakup - heart has its own memory separate from brain * We’ve only done small rollbacks before - to do so many at once is irresponsible and crazy * Friend sarah has done it before, and shes so much happier it seems * Scene 1: doing the rollback * 2: memory glitches * 3: full breakdown * 4: seeing him again, resolution and acceptance *
3. related to power 
	1. semiconductor x dune x sand
