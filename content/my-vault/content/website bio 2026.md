Hi, I'm Annie!

I grew up in Jersey, spent time in upstate New York, and now split my time between NYC and SF. I’m drawn to cities, systems, and the people and processes that keep them alive.

My earliest memories exist within games (Pokemon and Maplestory were early obsessions) and I first got into GPUs working on Amazon’s GameLift team. Today, I work at OpenAI on scaling operations and maintaining the health of an ever-growing compute fleet. Previously, I drove hardware health work for one of the world’s largest supercomputers at Azure.

I’m a techno-optimist who cares about making technology accessible for people of all backgrounds. In undergrad, I wrote learning materials for AI4ALL and contributed to open-source NLP tools.

Outside of work, I over-think on how to cultivate creative spaces through Wayward↗, a project exploring how we create meaning, sustain memory, and share art with our neighbors. 

I'm energized by those who share a sense of generosity, are curious and intentional, and true to who they are.
