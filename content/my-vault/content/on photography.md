it’s a philosophical, cultural autopsy of what photography does to reality, memory, power, and our moral lives.
photography replaces memory with archive
archive:
- fixes a moment in time
- outlives the moment


Photographs are a way of imprisoning reality. Photographing is essentially an act of non-intervention. The camera is the ideal arm of consciousness in its acquisitive mood. A photograph is both a pseudo-presence and a token of absence.

images → voyeurism; exposure → numbing; photographing → refusal of experience.
