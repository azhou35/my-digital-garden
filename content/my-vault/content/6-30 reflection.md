title: "6-30 reflection"
---

my parents came to the apartment after 2 weeks of not getting to sit down for a dinner at home 
-- i think of how rare it is every night, we sat together for our nightly dinner ritual
	-- how beautiful even now we can do this
-- overwhelmed by gratitude for my parents
-- my dad tells me his vision swims when he looks at the screen
	-- he has to increase the size ten-fold 
-- he tells me he wants to retire, that he cant keep up any more
	-- that he's the only foreigner, he's the oldest one, he knows his time is out 
-- my vision swims as he tells me how proud he is, i watch his cracked hands, peeling, peel open a clementine for me without second thought, he admits he's getting old
	-- he used to just say getting *older*, why is he saying *old* now?
	-- im no stranger to crying at the dinner table, but this is different now, my grief so precocious it's inappropriate to articulate, my pain so melancholy i color it pastel
-- they say there's still so much of the world they haven't explored. haven't seen the rest of china, ever since dad came to the us at 23 w only 100 in his backpocket. can you imagine seeing the other side of the world before you've explored your own backyard? 
	-- my dad had few vacation days, and i hated going back to china -- he always spent it on cool experiences for me, dubai, italy, spain, all the places western media paints ideally
-- i turn 23 next year. at this age it seemed every decision my parents made were in anticipation of their future children. at this age i cannot fathom a child under my wing. 

im starting to get it, now. at some point we reach a carrying capacity at how far our ambitions can grow. so we will re-direct it back into our kids, with as much fervor as we carried for our career. nothing drives some harder than hope. our [[locus of control]] redirects into our children.
