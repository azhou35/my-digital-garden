title: "traba preparation"
---

> “I joined Microsoft two years ago at a pivotal time period for our contract with OpenAI, building out the supercomputers and huge GPUs they use for the large scale ML workloads. 
> and I currently work as a product manager owning supercomputing operations for OpenAI at Microsoft — focusing on infra reliability, GPU supply chains, and enabling datacenter workers and internal engineering teams to repair these complex systems. I've built internal tools to help us track and automate these workflow operations.
> also built copilot tools to help automate onboarding onto our workflow managemnet services   
> i've always been very startup curious - i was the first pm at a legal tech startup focusing on the contract negotiation problem, and regularly write startup breakdowns for contrary research. 
>i ve seen how important it is to build for reliability and scale and looking to work closer to growth / ops at a fast-growing company 


> I’m interested in joining Traba because I see it solving one of the most under-optimized coordination problems in the economy: how to match frontline labor with real-time demand. That problem looks a lot like the ones I solve now — just with people instead of hardware.”
- connection:
	- the process of building the parts for a supercomputing and switching them out is highly operational 
	- first hand experience on the complexity of gpu repair and the coordination across supply chain teams
	- growth / pm roles
	- current job
		- _"I currently lead software operations excellence for GPU supercomputing at Microsoft, in close partnership with OpenAI. My day-to-day centers around ensuring high uptime and efficiency across a rapidly scaling global infrastructure — which means I’m constantly working across supply chain, logistics, and the operational pain points of datacenter workers. I’m interested in translating these learnings into a faster-paced, earlier-stage environment that’s tackling similar ops-complexity challenges at a different scale — like Traba."_
	- supply chain responsibilities
		- "One of my core responsibilities has been to ensure GPU capacity meets planned AI workloads — and that’s often bottlenecked by labor coordination. So I’ve seen firsthand how fragile things can get when labor pipelines aren’t fluid
	- building interal tools
		- happiest when I’m building systems in chaotic environments. At Microsoft x OpenAI, that’s meant designing tools and playbooks from scratch.
- questions they ask me
	- why traba
		- I’ve seen how labor coordination can make or break a system
	- what are you hoping to learn or do in your next role that ur not doing today
		- - Emphasize your desire to own more end-to-end (ideation → test → scale)
	- We had to manage both the hardware supply chain and labor availability — it was like matching demand spikes to shift-based humans.
	- > “At OpenAI scale, nothing works unless it’s automated and self-correcting. I’m excited by the idea of bringing that same loop-thinking to customer acquisition and labor liquidity.”
- questions:
	- biggest bottlenecks to growth? 
	- > “How are you thinking about growing city supply while maintaining worker quality?”  
> 	“Where do you think Traba’s core growth loops are strongest — and where do they break down?”  
> 	“What growth bets are you most excited about over the next 6 months — and what’s your approach to de-risking them?”

managed staffing
staffing is the trojan horsefor a broader suite of 
working side

going from contingent labor
direct hires

software
demand forecasting
better demand firecasting

similar tension with me right now

enterprise motion
systems and processes to make growth much more definable 
high level growth strategy

operations 
- three buckets
- growth ops
	- new sales
	- outbounds
	- resistant to change
	- burned b y legacy
	- 
- customer opers
	- accountable for customer and scaling
	- relationship building
	- acocount expansion
	- technical solutions required to scale 
- worker  ops
	- executing the service
	- strategic projects
	- driving scale

lack of trust 
decisions are o 

build that trust
