dear memory,

shortly after my birthday this month, i received an email i wrote to myself four years ago.i was one dramatic mfer. written with all the earnestness and inner turmoil of a coming-of-age teen, i couldn’t help but chuckle my dramatic turns-of-phrase. at the end, i listed memories i didn’t want to forget, many of which hadn’t crossed my mind in years. 

Chang: memory “isn’t something that blooms, but something that bleeds internally.” [from description: it is willed, summoned, and dragged to the surface.

“Memory is everything, yet it is nothing. Memory is mine, but it is also clinging to the memory of others.”

Julia creet: maybe memory is where we have arrived rather than where ew have left. 

![But the heart has its own memory and I have forgotten nothing.](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeQsWuZbqhzzLr2y1VO--KQqcrdpmKZDQ-a64g1wMBp5eGzc3qlokyAVUOtpP4HgY5K9gN7TwvxbldO1ah3HxXAlxhx7HrO0gIwMgZS4tRwYDjgn2hz1xbAaKr8irMN3YVVN-HosQWoI2EuW3XjMlb_uL64?key=mElVfUJMYbSPnLBTcc965A "But the heart has its own memory and I have forgotten nothing.")

- how the emotional quality of the past (nostalgia) and the future (yearning) affects the way we perceive time and how quickly it moves
    
- I’m either running away from my memories, or towards them. In both cases i forget that time is not solid, but rather liquid. time is lucid, it’s slippery. i am just a fish victim to the current.
    

- Movie: joel literally running through his memories, camera shaky, dark spots flooding in to indicate the memories being erased by his very eyes. 
    

- E.E. Scott — 'Most days I am a museum of things I want to forget.'
    
- eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
    

if you had the choice to forget, would you take it?

on time capsules

for all the incompleteness digital records of my past hold, meaning is further abstracted away in my material possesions. in my childhood home i hunt for what to bring to new york. i scour through old items and take an extra pause. each one a pointer to a melange of images and sounds.

what is writing if not a time capsule of you in the past—old worldviews, insecurities, , self-reflection is our purest attempt at

- victoria chang
    
- it’s funny how when i look back, details-faces-names blend together. all that’s left are the filtered feels. i don’t remember what i was mad about, just that i was mad. sepia-toned sadness seeps into worn photos of estranged friends. prismatic joy pulsates from . i reread forgotten love letters scrawled on notebook paper
    

on intergenerational memory

Is this really an annie post without some commentary on family? (no) what do i remember? what don’t i remember? how do we read between the lines? 

at yu & me books, we follow a writing prompt to write down “i remember…” and “i don’t remember…” 

I don’t remember my grandma, no matter how many times my mom says i’m a reminder of her. 

I don’t remember when my dad started to forget things. But i remember my fear for it is still with me. 

  

“finding memories is a bit like free diving, although i’ve never free dived befre. You jump in the water and hold your breath as long as you can without dying and hope you come up with a memory or two. Then there’s the problem of opening the memory.

cotton-candy moments

yesterday i squatted at domino park with my dear friend v. hands greasy with fries & elote, we reminisced about our shared memories in sophomore year, the first time we met, and shared stories of what we were like as children. that time i peaked in third grade and got the most stickers in class / when i played with friends who collected onion grass from the ground / when he would beg for a dog  

these liquid memories spill out without a second thought. at times it’s hard to visualize the exact setting or world i allude to: i just see a hazy scene, like a movie set, where the world is set up for that moment and nothing else.

[“Memories are like flies swarming through the air, jumbled-up bits of memory,” Agnès Varda says in The Beaches of Agnès. “The vignette disrupts the notion of life as a narrative arc,” writes Dodie Bellamy in “Unbearable Intimacies.” * I feel more honest when I tell you stories in bits and pieces.
