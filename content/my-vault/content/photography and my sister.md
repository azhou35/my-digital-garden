#photography 
when A left for college, there was an absence but not a lack of her. one day i came back and her room was empty and sucked of its gravity: the astronomy books floating mid-air, cvs 4x6 photo prints barely clinging to the wall by way of blue putty.  

i pored over these forsaken artifacts as a tether back to A. these things that have become mine, by way of inheritance / lineage. i'd sit cross-legged atop her bed and look at pictures of her travels in europe and west coast excursions with classmates. picture-perfect pieces as i try to assemble a story of her, a puzzle without a reference image. 

i read the carl sagan books A left behind. carl sagan said something like *we are the way for the universe to know itself*. what he had should have said is *the cosmos is the way for us to know ourselves*. 

i dreamed of seeing the night sky sparkle with the luster as he described. *the stars are within us* and i envisioned cracking you open. like a geode, revealing the milky way inside. 
at night i'd tiptoe down into the living room and haul A's unwieldy telescope to the window, squint into its viewfinder and point it to the sky. all i see is darkness. 

---------------------------------------

i fell, hard, for photography in hawaii. the day A handed me her camera, **her** baby, a mirrorless fujifilm that felt as light as air. i’ve been taking photos for a while. trusty nikon at my steed, two-pounder i lugged under my arm for yearbook photos and vacations. dad was proud when he gifted me it to me at christmas. but my pictures came out dull and i grew sullen. 
**why don’t my pictures look like hers?**
come sunset the sky bloomed into a million colors and i aimed her camera lens at its unfolding. the first time i could see the sky the way she did. it was the first time that i could capture photos like her. 

photography is my plea: i want to see the world the way that you do. i want to show you the way i see the world. 

----------------------

for my 18th birthday, i bit the bullet and bought A's same exact camera. my clumsy hands fiddle the buttons with the same sort of familiarity as when i clung to her hand. never was one much for weaponry, but that day, i understand the power of control. sometimes photos looked more vivid than reality. the camera infused my dying campus with saturated colors. **film simulations,** they called it, years of color science breathing life back into our decaying humanities building. i was obsessed. the beauty of the world leapt at me and i could manipulate the colors with the touch of a button. i could shape the world the way i wanted to. **crush the blacks, modulate the tone curve.** hours in lightroom, painstakingly spot touching flyaway hairs. i’d text A with my photo edits, lap dog looking for a treat. **look, look, i hope it looks like yours.**

every morning last month, i run down the path towards battery park city. [describe run].
i could wax poetic a million times about the autumn leaves -- the honeylocus leaves the perfect shade of canary such that they glow under the withering sun's gaze; the fuzzy shadows they cast against grey boardwalk; the one tree by bpc esplanade's right angle that stays green, save for one patch of yellow. 

in several photo walks i try to take pictures of the leaves. cruel paradox, how the most beautiful things are sometimes the hardest to capture. words fail, pictures fall short, videos scratch the surface of this indescribable feeling. how can i help you see the world the way i did in that moment? 

in west village my fujifilm's sensors wrestle with the withering midday light. go east and still there's futile fight of shadows and overposed brights, chiaroscuro singing her sweet tune. in prospect park the light overwhelms even my own corneas.

i just want pretty leaf pictures. in prospect park the yolky sunset paints the park in an intoxicating glow. the vision that's seized my mind escapes materialization once i click the trigger. 

sometimes, the life that unfolds in front of us is too much to contain.

i feel this with words, sometimes, often. a brilliant galaxy reveals itself before me and all i can articulate is a few stars. maybe this is why i adore poetry, or why i pair my words with photos. im looking for some sort of resonance in these atomized elements in a futile attempt to show you life the way i see it.

sometimes with A, words fail. but i when take a photo of the sky i send it to her, i hope that is enough.
