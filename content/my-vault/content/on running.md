why do I walk?

I think his life was brilliantly inspiring — However, if you read his book, you can also see that traveling a lot made him disconnected from reality — running at a 100mph. He never felt like he had a home — or found peace. Traveling is unforgettable, but there is nothing like coming Home. A lesson in there.

* if you keep running it means you're not comfortable sitting with yourself 
existentialist concerns about authenticity and the struggle for meaning in a complex world.

Why do you write?

What are you running away from?

Why do you write like you’re running out of time? 

What is running through your mind? 

What are you looking for?

Why do you ask questions before you can answer? 

  

“A poem should not mean / But be.”

But i am a meaning-making monkey. 

 “ Become who you are.”

  

How do i become who i am when i want to become something more? 

Am i limited by my own unwillingness to push myself?

  
  

I’m too comfortable with modulating my voice to fit different situations.

Obsessed with the best way to “present” myself on job applications, social media, dating apps.

  

It’s hard to evangelize a personal philosophy without dipping into pretension.

yet i want some north star to ground myself. 

I’ve been putting myself out on the internet without any real intention. 

aka wandering on the web. Without real creed, rhyme or reason. 

  

I’ve been thinking of my personal “rebrand.” redesigning my website, revamping my wardrobe, etc. created a summer moodboard for the ~ vibe ~ i wanted to express. 

I have the vibes i want, i have the outcome i want, but its easier to talk than to execute.

to remind my soles of the kiss of asphalt, calm my soul with the rhythmic tempo 

why do i write? 

  

what beauty do you appreciate? 

i’ve watched perfect days and paterson recently. both main characters fixate on photography & poetry, respectively, as their insular hobbies.

choose your own adventure: free-verse on identity

  

hi. this is me as a free verse

- why do you run? 
    

- for love of runner highs & cortisol overdoses, engine in overdrive 
    
- the best reminder of your breath is taking it away from your lungs 
    
- what are you running away from? 
    

-   
    

- who are you running away from? 
    

-   
    

- where are you running to? 
    

-   
    

- why do you write?
    

-   
    

- why do you shoot photos?
    

- for love of the world
    

  

- why do you create?
    

- why do we exhale, if not to see our breath in the air? 
    
- why do we stand, if not to affirm our right to space? 
    
- why do we speak, if not to hear our own voice? 
    

-   
    
- i’d like to become who you..
