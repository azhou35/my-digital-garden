- generalists are especially good in wicked environments when the rules of the game are unclear/incomplete there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both
- generalist are usually curious people who like to hop around from domain to domain. They enjoy figuring things out, especially in areas that are uncertain or new. They’re good at solving problems that domain experts struggle with, because they’re able to bring bits of knowledge from diverse fields together.
- t shaped thumb: high leverage generalists
	- spot patterns across unrelated domains
	- identify novel solutions by combining exisitng ideas
- eg 
	- infrastructure + analytics
		- Most companies have infrastructure teams that don't understand data flows, and analytics teams that don't grasp infrastructure constraints. But when you understand both, you can architect systems that handle real-world scale while actually delivering business value. You see opportunities to optimise infrastructure based on usage patterns that others miss entirely.
	- ML + sysadmin
		- You can build self-healing systems that predict failures before they happen and automate complex operational decisions. This isn't just about running models - it's about building intelligent infrastructure that actually works in production.
- learning leverage
	- knowledge compounds - you see second-order effects that specialists often miss
- understanding how systems work at a fundamental level allows u to 
	- 1. Rapidly prototype solutions in new domains.
	1. Identify high-leverage intervention points in complex systems.
