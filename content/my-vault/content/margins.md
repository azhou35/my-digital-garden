submit to the margins 
[Asian American Writers' Workshop Submission Manager](https://aaww.submittable.com/submit)

We publish: 1) original creative writing, whether poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, or even interdisciplinary work; 2) essays on literature and politics by sophisticated thinkers who can speak to a general audience about race, gender, sexuality, immigration, postcolonialism, pop culture, and diaspora; 3) reportage about immigrant communities in NYC by narrative storytellers who can set a scene with rich imagery and descriptive detail. 

Our stories have been linked to by the _Wall Street Journal_, the _New Inquiry_ and the _New York Times_. Our contributors have included Jessica Hagedorn, Hanya Yanagihara, Chang-rae Lee, Bhanu Kapil, Ashok Kondabolu, Jenny Zhang, Katie Kitamura, Hua Hsu, Kim Hyesoon, Alexander Chee, Vijay Iyer, and Yoko Ogawa. See below for ways you can submit your work!

“Who are you and whom do you love?” asks Bhanu Kapil in _The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers._ In this polyvocal collection, Kapil weaves personal and imagined histories into a tapestry of women’s postcolonial experience, moving back and forth between South Asia and the diaspora. Abstraction, collage, docupoetics, and the prose poem are just some of the formal devices that allow for this movement. 

As two authors engaging with intergenerational storytelling, personal archives, and memory, we are interested in expanding how we write about our own lineages, using imagination to look backward—writing into the gaps that history, or silence, has left behind—and forward, into the future as a place that is informed by a reimagined history.

To write about who we are and the people that we love, we must observe, learn, and glean what we can from the intimacies of our relationships—and navigate what goes unsaid. Can you write around a secret without giving it away? Or does writing the secret set you, or the ones you love, free? What happens when you, as Megan compels us in “[Earth-Like](https://www.swwim.org/swwimeveryday/2022/10/14/earth-like),”  “imagine you could begin again”? What is it like to, as Kiran directs in “How to take root,” “imagine a nonlinear lineage”? 

We invite you to submit to “Imagined Histories,” a new folio to be published in _The Margins_ in late 2025. We want your best poems (ghazals, free verse, sonnets, prose poems, hybrid forms, all styles welcome) or visual art (think photo essays, maps, collages, drawings). Experimental and hybrid works are welcome as are traditional forms. Our mission to catalog our collected visions, confessions, and dreaming. 

For reference, we are looking for new work in the tradition of:

- Bhanu Kapil: _The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers, Schizophrene, Incubation: A Space for Monsters_
- Claudia Rankine: _Citizen: An American Lyric_
- Emily Jungmin Yoon: _A Cruelty Special to Our Species_
- Marwa Helal: _Invasive species_
- Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge_: Hello, the Roses_
- Hala Alyan: _The Twenty-Ninth Year_
- Victoria Chang: _Obit_
- Morgan Parker: _Magical Negro, There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonce_
- Divya Victor: _Curb, Kith_

**Submissions are open until July 15th, 2025. You can only submit to ONE open call at AAWW at a time. If you have already submitted to Poetry Tuesday this year, you can NOT also submit to this call.**
