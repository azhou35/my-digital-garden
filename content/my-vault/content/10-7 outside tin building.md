this moment is beautiful:
4:27 PM Seaport
* frank ocean *sweet life* pulsing in my ears
* the canary flowers behind me reflecting on my computer screen
* a group dressed in the nines, an open bottle of champagne and the remains of chocolate cake
* i look above and FDR cuts from the bottom left to top right of my vision
	* the busses whip themselves silly as they whizz downtown 
* soft 4pm sunlight casting a youthful glow 
* martyr! in my lap, a green post-it note sticking out 
* me, slouched in a wicker two-seater, attempting to do work on a table slightly-too-high-for-me, on a computer slightly-too-big-for-me
* whisper of october breeze 
* the sky a pantone cerulean that fades into white when it collapses into horizon 
* imposing ships, bows outstretched to the cityscape
