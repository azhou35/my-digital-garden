This appears to be notes about a product operations role focused on spend management at Ramp, with emphasis on launching and supporting various financial products.

Sam Walton cut Walmart’s supply chain down from 5 components to 3. Henry Ford cut the time to complete a car from 12 hours to 93 minutes. We cut the cost to buy anything from 30 minutes to 30 seconds. Ramp puts the advice of history’s greatest entrepreneurs on autopilot. It’s why the best-run businesses run on Ramp.
> growing up my fav class was actually a history of engineering processes and learned about jit and ford and all these things we did to make things more optimized 


across the board the feedback is ramp is easy to use 
for something as tedious as admin work we should be trying to unblock users from headaches not creating it

Why Ramp
i had a friend telling me he was working on a DDR game 

values:
customer centric
speed and ownership
growth and learning
automation
scale 

He started a religion around saving.

Ramp offers a suite of financial software—distributing credit cards to employees, paying bills, and managing expense approvals—for companies, all focused on helping them spend less time and money by automating a lot of the work that is usually done manually. For example, rather than users having to submit expense reports via email at the end of each month, Ramp lets them text the receipt as soon as the purchase occurs. The product suite is full of little automations like this—useful, quick actions that add up to saving customers money.
Ramp is worthy of study not because they built a big company, but because they did so with complete harmony between their mission and their actions. Their product strategy, compensation, customer set—all of it is defined around the central goal of saving time and money. And they do it in a way that isn’t exploitative or hokey, but that focuses everyone who works there on what matters.
Shortly after, they bundled them with expense management software focused on tracking how employees used them. The goal was to automate the perennially annoying process of having to submit receipts to your company so that employees could save time, and companies could better understand how they were spending money.

To understand what makes Ramp so remarkable, you need to understand that all of B2B software is essentially just a spreadsheet. If enough businesses need a spreadsheet to solve a specific problem—say, for example, tracking credit card spend—then voilà, you have an idea for a company. This is called a point solution, meaning that the software only solves one problem.

Ramp’s mission is to _reduce_ how much clients spend. They figured out that even though a company would spend less on their platform, building software that allowed clients to do vendor consolidation or reduce credit card spend would help them lock in more clients.

The product team’s compensation structure is designed to incentive employees “to do more with less,” Charles told me, which is in contrast to a typical compensation structure that is based on managing more headcount and revenue growth. “It's less about your total breadth and total output. The math [driving compensation] is divided by the number of employees and the costs of your team.

im deeply satisfied by aligning mission metric s

questions:
the shift from corporate card and spend management software to comprehensive **financial orchestration platform**.

How Ramp does it is its secret sauce, a blend of **people, structure, and mission**.
, “We hire people for potential and growth trajectory, **slope over intercept**. We make bets on people. The goal is not zero defects, but 10x potential.”
