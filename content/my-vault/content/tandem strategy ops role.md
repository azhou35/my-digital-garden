### **Tell me about yourself**

My story starts in Central Jersey. Growing up i went to an engineering high school, but I was always the one interested in a mixture of the technical and humanities. I did a bunch of bio research into vaccine development, actually optimizing the cold chain, and even wanted to go into bioinformatics at first. But what I really was my passion has always been trying to ingest complexity and dive into the messiest problems and use quantitiative tools to tackle human problems.

This led me to data science at Cornell, got involved in our VC club where I learned to use this skills for startups.  I was alwyas drawn to open ended nature of startups and the problems they tackle. Since college I've done a couple things w that ecosystem - one thing is in my free time I write research briefs for Contrary. And at work, I built a business case for partnering with life sciences startups in AI Drug discovery. 

Strategy really clicks for me. The bulk of my job is very adaptable - Its not a typical PM job and thats what drawn me to microsoft. sometimes im building data dashboards then the next day I'm prototyping these multi-agent AI systems for genomics researchers.

One of the coolest projects I got to work on was mapping out the business plan for our life sciences vertical - basically figuring out how these AI drug discovery startups need compute and what that market opportunity could look like. Chatted with our in-house pharmacy experts, worked with business development to draw an action plan, and interviewed these startups on their workflows. That strategic stuff really clicked for me.

I really love that messy middle ground where you're figuring out what customers actually need and how to scale it. So I'm looking forward to opportunities that allow me to stay close to the customer and drive impact in the areas that matter. 



### **Why Tandem?**

To me, any stage when im recruiting requires me think about my compulsion. What drives me? Find myself driven easiest when i am compelled to them inherently. Tandem presents a very natural confluence of these factors. I can break it down into these three
1. personal connection
2. passion equity 
3. ppl i met

First off "I've had a personal connection to healthcare challenges since I was young. As the child of immigrants, I spent countless hours at our dining table helping my parents navigate confusing insurance policies and healthcare claims, often translating medical jargon and calling doctors to ensure they received proper care.

This sparked my interest in making healthcare more accessible - from my high school science fair project where I created an automatic pill dispenser, to my recent work at Microsoft where I mapped out strategic business plans for our life sciences vertical and analyzed AI compute needs for drug discovery startups. I'm convinced technology's most transformative application is in life sciences, and Tandem's belief that "science should be the only limit to medicine" really hits home for me.

What really sealed the deal for me was attending Tandem's anniversary party last month. The conversations I had with team members there confirmed everything I'd hoped about the culture. People were genuinely passionate about the problems they were solving, and I noticed this electric mix of intensity and friendliness. Everyone I spoke with had this remarkable blend of ambition and humility - they were clearly brilliant but focused entirely on impact rather than ego. It felt like exactly the kind of environment where I'd thrive.

### **Why strategy & Ops**
When i think about it a first things pop out.
With strategy & ops team i see an opportunity that can combine my analytical strengths and operational experience with something i look forward to to driving outcoms for company.
First of all, while ive built a foundation in product management, I'm particularly drawn to Strategy & Operations because it allows me to have a broader impact across the business. In my current role at Microsoft, I've found that I thrive most when I'm working on day to day business outcomes for our client, in this case openai. driving strategic business planning that translated technical AI requirements into operational resource allocation.

**second**, 
what I've realized is that I'm energized by the variety and scope that comes with S&O work.
i enjoy diving into multiple workstreams at once, that leverage you know left side right side of the brain. 
driving this strategy and translaing x into practical business outcomes
thats what make me really energized
What I've realized is that I'm energized by the variety and scope that comes with S&O work. I enjoy diving into multiple workstreams simultaneously, whether that's optimizing operations, driving strategic initiatives, or building data-driven frameworks that influence business decisions. At Microsoft, some of my most fulfilling work has been developing operational efficiency frameworks and driving strategic business planning that translated technical AI requirements into operational resource allocation.

i just enjoy business-critical work. in this case strategy & ops would empower me to zoom out a bit and see whether a business can scale, and that alignment is reallly xciting.


**third**, chatting w mroe ppl
more ppl i get to know them 
it seems like its very aligned to the fundamental business problem of delivery and access
im someone who rlly enjoys the immediate impact of my work 
it's not always the best mindset in a large company but it's led me down the path of the problems with the biggst business impact


I've actually been chatting with a couple of the current Strategy & Ops folks at Tandem, and what they've shared has me even more excited. It sounds like the role is completely aligned with Tandem's core value proposition - being very operational and focused on delivery and access. That resonates with me because I'm someone who loves seeing immediate impact from my work.


In Strategy & Operations at Tandem, I see the opportunity to combine my analytical strengths, operational experience, and passion for healthcare accessibility in a role where I can truly own problems and drive outcomes that matter

### Tandem INfo
Tandem Summary • What They Do: Tandem uses AI to streamline prescription management, automating prior authorizations, navigating insurance, and routing meds to pharmacies for cost and speed. • Mission: Reduce healthcare “sludge” so providers focus on care, patients get meds faster/cheaper, and biopharma gains access insights. • Business Model: B2B service for healthcare practices (subscription or per-prescription fees); potential biopharma partnerships for data/revenue. • Operations: ◦ AI handles approvals, cost optimization, and pharmacy coordination. ◦ Integrates with EHRs, insurers, and pharmacies via APIs. ◦ Scales via modular tech and lean, cross-functional teams. • Users: ◦ Providers: Doctors/admins seeking less paperwork. ◦ Patients: Want quick, affordable meds. ◦ Pharmacies: Process Tandem-routed prescriptions. • User Pain Points: ◦ Providers: Time sinks, AI trust, integration hiccups. ◦ Patients: Delays, cost confusion, lack of direct updates. ◦ Pharmacies: Coordination overload, reimbursement lags, data gaps. • Growth: Backed by Thrive Capital/Bain Capital Ventures; expanding via adoption and specialty drugs. • Role Relevance: Strategy & Ops drives efficiency (e.g., fix bottlenecks), growth (e.g., new markets), and user satisfaction (e.g., trust tools).

What I've realized is that I'm energized by the variety and scope that comes with S&O work. I enjoy diving into multiple workstreams simultaneously, whether that's optimizing operations, driving strategic initiatives, or building data-driven frameworks that influence business decisions. At Microsoft, some of my most fulfilling work has been developing operational efficiency frameworks and driving strategic business planning that translated technical AI requirements into operational resource allocation.

I'm also drawn to the business-critical nature of S&O work. In product management, you're often focused on specific user problems and feature sets, but in S&O, you're tackling core challenges that determine whether a business can scale effectively. That alignment between operational excellence and business success is what excites me most about the role at Tandem.

I've actually been chatting with a couple of the current Strategy & Ops folks at Tandem, and what they've shared has me even more excited.

My product experience means I can translate customer needs into actionable plans and drive efficiency. And having worked at the intersection of technical and business teams, I'm comfortable collaborating with Engineering to define and launch new features.
