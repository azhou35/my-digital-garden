title: "hume on taste"
---

Ask anyone if they think they know everything there is to know in the entire world, and they'll invariably tell you, 'No, that's ridiculous.' Yet so many people spend their entire lives desperately trying to validate what they already think they know..
-> my takeaway is that people can evaluate taste based on their different frameworks and come up with different opinions, but its the framework that can be faulty 
common pitfalls for taste-makers are to index on:
1. nostalgia
	1. ofc you will prioritize songs that are nostalgic to you 
2. falsified novelty
	1. reserve judgement that its musically better just bc its "better"
3. complexity 

question your assumptions and take it to its natural conclusion 
if youre an ideal critic of art, look at something and see the entire art

you need to cultivate the eye for detail 
pre-req for an "art critic"
4. eye for detail
5. practice 
6. comparison to other art
7. you need a strong sense - strong presence

anti recs:
1. no prejudice if you like/dislike the artist

**Key Argument (In Speaker's Words)** "Ask anyone if they think they know everything there is to know in the entire world, and they'll invariably tell you, 'No, that's ridiculous.' Yet so many people spend their entire lives desperately trying to validate what they already think they know."

**Hume's Core View (Direct Quote)** "Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character."

**Entertaining Examples of Bad Art Criticism:**

2. **The Dubstep Guy** "This is the same guy that will look you straight in the face—like, he is dead serious when he says this—he will look you dead in the eyes and say that dubstep is the greatest music that has ever been composed in the history of planet earth, dubstep."
3. **The SpongeBob Shakespeare** The friend who insisted SpongeBob was revolutionary for using "concrete jungle" - "You just don't want to admit that a cartoon is the pioneer of culture of your time period."
4. **The CD Walking Story** Speaker's personal bias from homeless days: "I'd just cycle in between these 2 CDs over and over again... And how convenient that for the next several years of my life, whenever somebody asked me what my favorite music was, I would point directly to these 2 albums."

**Common Faulty Criteria People Use:**

5. **Nostalgia**: "What a coincidence that the vast majority of them point directly to the music that they listened to when they were a senior in high school"
6. **False Novelty**: Like thinking SpongeBob invented "concrete jungle"
7. **Complexity**: "The problem with this thinking is that complexity does not necessarily imply superiority"

**Hume's Fascinating Observation** "The greatest scientist of our generation will probably not be the greatest scientist of the next generation... But for some reason, the da Vincis, the Homers, the Shakespeares—the brilliance of these people is oddly timeless. How do you explain that? How crazy is it that we can read a poem written thousands of years ago and still recognize it as greatness?"
