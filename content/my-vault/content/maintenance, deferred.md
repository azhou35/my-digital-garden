title: "maintenance, deferred"
---

_Our thesis is basically that our culture’s obsession with innovation and hype has lead us to neglect maintenance and maintainers_

Capitalism excels at innovation but is failing at maintenance, and for most lives it is maintenance that matters more.

maintenance disrupts our every day lives - 

_Plumbers run the world_

Infrastructure failures – train crashes, bridge failures, urban flooding, and so on – are manifestations of and allegories for America’s dysfunctional political system, its frayed social safety net, and its enduring fascination with flashy, shiny, trivial things

Maintenance, as a job, as a service business, as a care practice, as a political movement, was another key theme in the course. We discussed what counts as maintenance, who performs the labor of maintenance, when and where
We asked, if infrastructure is made invisible, who and why makes maintenance invisible? Whose bodies are exposed to dust, darkness, chemicals, and third shifts? How does a language of care transform discussions about infrastructure? We discussed how maintenance itself entails complex politics. After all, maintenance is about maintaining the status quo not only physically but also socially and politically

### deferred maintenance
- technical vs accounting
	- technical community makes distinctions between maintenance and repairs whereas accountants generally do not
	- Accountants typically look at maintenance and repairs as period costs requiring immediate expensing as opposed to capital improvements that become capitalized and depreciated over some future time period
	- Deferred maintenance is often not immediately reported—and sometimes, not at all
- estimated $1 trillion in accumulated deferred maintenance
	- Budget constraints and competing priorities often lead government agencies to postpone or delay planned maintenance to make funds available for other pressing needs.

- funding sources
	- general funds
	- special funds
	- issue bonds to finance deferred maintenance
- process of assessing deferred maintenance
	- regular physical inspections of infrastructure assets to evaluate their condition and identify needs
	- states that consider a broader range of infrastructure, individual state agencies take responsibility for the process
	- Smaller needs are usually included in the operating budget, while more costly ones are part of the capital budget.
- california
	- California established its Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program to address deferred maintenance on the state highway and local road system
	- Though the state’s infrastructure plan began referring to deferred maintenance needs of the University of California (UC) system in 2008, it did not emphasize the statewide maintenance backlog until 2014
	- LAO issued a list of recommendations in 2016 concerning additional reporting required for deferred maintenance projects. These requirements include requiring each department to provide a list of proposed projects to be funded
	- Infrastructure components inspected include roofs, building exteriors, elevators, heating and ventilation equipment and distribution systems, electrical and fire protection equipment, interior finishes, vertical and horizontal elements, site development, and utility systems. UC deferred maintenance projects cost more than $5,000; smaller projects are funded with regular maintenance funds.
	- California’s **Infrastructure Planning** Act
		- Requires governors budget to include estimates of deferred maintenance needs
		- funding and financing opportunites to address them 
- new york 
	- The City identified over $14.1 billion worth of state of good repair costs across all agencies from 2024 to 2027 through the Asset Information Management System (AIMS) Report
	- https://comptroller.nyc.gov/services/for-the-public/investing-in-nycs-infrastructure/infrastructure-planning/
- consequences:
	- - **$1+ trillion** in deferred public infrastructure maintenance nationwide (roads, bridges, schools, water, public buildings)
	- Roads and bridges alone account for **$100B+** in backlog, increasing lifecycle costs by multiples
	- Aging water systems lose **~6 billion gallons/day** to leaks—treated, pumped, paid-for water
	- School facilities: HVAC failures, unsafe buildings

### case study:

- nyc subway 
	- https://gothamist.com/news/a-state-of-collapse-how-the-mta-put-riders-on-the-fast-track-to-ruin 
- difficult to maintain bc:
	- We also went through a long period where transit wasn't maintained properly (1970s-early 2000s), so the last twenty yrs is going thru maintenance backlog
	- larger than most other systems
	- does not shut down overnight
	- priority is keeping system running
	- [MTA funding](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=MTA+funding+state&cId=c8639a08-1d6b-4d4c-b517-1b573c07a63d&iId=cb9bdd55-915b-44d6-9789-3156c491a583) comes from the state rather than the city, and upstate voters balk at too much money being spent downstate so it’s a constant battle.

	- https://gothamist.com/news/the-nyc-subways-electrical-equipment-is-so-old-it-frequently-explodes
	- maintaining power systems in the subway 
		- Electricity is to the subways what gasoline is to automobiles, and the MTA’s tank is running on fumes
		- 77 out of 224 substations – including the one in Harlem – are in “poor or marginal condition” and in dire need of replacement due to decades of deferred maintenance. A minor failure at a substation can quickly delay 30 trains
		- $3 billion to upgrade electrical infrastructure
		- The request is part of the MTA’s proposed $65 billion five-year capital plan that begins this year
		- The volatility of the equipment at the substation was obvious. If the current spikes on subway tracks near the substation, an arc of electricity whips from a circuit breaker as it self-destructs, spraying molten copper on the walls.
	- strained electrical systems are a key reason why the MTA can’t add more subway service. More trains require more voltage — and the MTA’s rush hour service is at its limit in nearly every corner of the city
	- modern transformers use fans to stay cool - at harlem electricity is delivered thru a transformer under constant use - cold water is pumped thru pipes to keep the 60 yr old piece of equipment from overheatigng
- mta - a state of collapse
	- https://gothamist.com/news/a-state-of-collapse-how-the-mta-put-riders-on-the-fast-track-to-ruin 
	- The number of train delays caused by faulty infrastructure and equipment last year shot up by 46% since 2021
	- MTA officials blame those problems on “deferred maintenance,” or decades of cost-saving measures that kept
	- MTA data shows that last August, an infrastructure or equipment problem caused a delay somewhere on New York City’s 665 miles of subway tracks every 3 minutes and 12 seconds. Three years before, those problems delayed a train every 5 minutes and 7 seconds
- steel beams 
	- rusted and need to be refurbished
	- Nearly five miles of tracks either need to be reinforced or require urgent repairs, according to MTA engineers
	- 
- history
	- Transit officials were forced to scale back maintenance work during the financial crisis of the 1970s. And during the 1990s, under former Gov. George Pataki, a reduction of state funding for the MTA’s construction budget forced the agency to take on [billions in debt](https://gothamist.com/news/a-48-billion-debt-is-crushing-the-mta-paying-it-off-could-disrupt-the-future-of-nyc-transit) that it’s still paying
	- exacerbated by climate change / flash floods
		- heavy rain can easily overwhelm the pumps. When the area was a wetland, a stream ran from where the 116 Street subway station is now to the East River
	- history of unfulfilled promises 
		- large projects after years of delays, cost overruns
			- e.g. east side access proj as grand central ran a decade behind schedule and 8 bill over budget
	- costs
		- Utility relocation remains one of the biggest reasons for New York City's high construction costs
		- Navigating the subterranean tangle of Con Ed, National Grid and city water pipes under the streets often requires the MTA to hire a specialist because there is no single map detailing the location of underground infrastructure.
	- deferred maintenance
		- era where infra was allowed to deteriorate post world war ii 
		- politicians redirect funds earmarked for state of good repair work
			- eg a half-billion dollar bond issue was passed to build the [Second Avenue Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Subway "Second Avenue Subway"), but money from this issue was used for other priorities and the building of short connector lines, namely a ramp extending the [IND Culver Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IND_Culver_Line "IND Culver Line") over the ex-BMT Culver Line at Ditmas and McDonald Avenues in Brooklyn
		- e.g. Gov. George Pataki cut state funding for the MTA’s construction plans
		- Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who appointed Lieber to lead the MTA days before resigning — redirected money for maintenance work to rush the completion of the Second Avenue Subway's first three Upper East Side stations by the end of 2016
		- robert moses diverted mass transit expansions in the 1970s to highways and parkways instead 
			- When Robert Moses came to power in New York in 1934, the city's mass transportation system was probably the best in the world. When he left power in 1968 it was quite possibly the worst

- pitch to spend $1.1 billion on new fare gates
	- agency loses $300 million a year to subway fare evasion, and that half of the people who enter without paying use the exit
### invisible labor
https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/delaware/transit-talk/9780813525778

- political systems prefer projects you can point to 
- labor 
	- requires less labor than a new construction project
- e.g. chinese tax returns benefit from new construction projects
- for mta - even the work trains are broken 
	- Westchester Locomotive Shop - facility's heaters broke down, forcing all work at the building to stop
	- difficult to motivate personnel to work when it’s 32 degrees or 40 degrees inside your workspace
- types of labor:
https://www.laborpress.org/saving-the-system-one-track-a-time-inside-the-hidden-work-of-mtas-signal-inspectors/
	- conductors
	- engineers
	- station cleaners
	- signal inspectors
		- preventative maintenance  make sure that the complex system of electrical circuits functions smoothly. This often involves working out on the roadbed, where workers face hazards from live train traffic and electricity
		- rail workers who do highly technical, critical work
		- simple problems like a break in the cables to more complicated electrical issues, which involve computers to fix
	- cleaners
		- https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/what-the-invisible-people-cleaning-the-subway-want-riders-to-know-6700751.html
		- cleaning the train of excretement 
		- said the agency was disinfecting the subway with the help of “licensed and reputable outside companies whose performance is monitored regularly.” The cleaning program, which the MTA plans to continue indefinitely, will cost about $300 million this year.
		- anecdote:
			- worked for nearly three months without a place to eat lunch or access to the station bathroom.

- strategic deception 
- deliberate deception
	- megaprojs are startd by ppl who never end them
