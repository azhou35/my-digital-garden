title: "post 3.19.25 writing club reflection"
---

* great time gathering people in one place, ~15 ppl was a good size
* should i involve this w verci? i dunno
* positive feedback:
	* ppl enjoyed the space, the view of the city and there's a rooftop garden
	* ppl enjoyed the thoughtful conversation (ofc)
	* the interim side chatter was the most valuable part 
my own thoughts:
* technology and progress has advanced such that so much has changed, but the core tenets and questions of human nature are the same. like, im sure james baldwin had problems with situationships too
justin & i's conversations: 
* potential of substack's multimodality
* we are on like level 10 substack while ppl r still griping about video feature
* icp as asian girlie 

wayward writing club substack:
it starts with an experiment. 
in august justin & i took the bookbear matchmaking survey and asked ourselves *what if we met all of our friend's matches?*
after meeting our matches, we had an idea to take the matchmaking experiment a step further - bringing together our friends (and their matches) to an unofficial meetup for Bookbear fans in NYC.
We had a feeling that we would get along with other Bookbear readers, thinking and talking about the same topics that are so core to our identity. This experience made us think there’s a community in NYC to be built around this ethos :)"
my thesis is that people who write on substack are likely to get along with each other.
my goal is to bring together that community. 
the day before spring we gathered to write together. 
henrik karlsenson: *writing is a seach query for your community*

"Justin and I are long-time fans of Bookbear Express. After meeting our matches, we had an idea to take the matchmaking experiment a step further - bringing together our friends (and their matches) to an unofficial meetup for Bookbear fans in NYC. It was a joy to organize this and we wanted to thank you for setting up the survey and writing stories that help us all feel seen. We had a feeling that we would get along with other Bookbear readers, thinking and talking about the same topics that are so core to our identity. This experience made us think there’s a community in NYC to be built around this ethos :)"
