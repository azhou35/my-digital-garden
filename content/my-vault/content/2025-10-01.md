- The Tail at Scale” (Dean & Barroso), “Omega: Flexible, Scalable Schedulers for Large Compute Clusters,” and system-design write-ups on Borg/Kubernetes/Mesos are excellent.
- - Watch: CMU 15-445 Lecture “Introduction to Distributed Systems” (on YouTube).
- - Skim Kubernetes basics (pods, nodes, control plane, scheduling). Focus on how it scales.
- Read Google Borg paper summary → foundational to cluster orchestration.
- - Read: _Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models_ (Kaplan et al., 2020) → why infra demand explodes.
- Skim: “Efficient Large-Scale Language Model Training on GPU Clusters” (Google/Meta).
- - **Books (skim, not read cover to cover):**
    - _Google SRE Book_ (focus on incidents + ops).
    - _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_ (skim ch. 1–3).
- **Talks:**    
    - Martin Kleppmann’s talks on distributed data systems.
        
    - NVIDIA GTC talks on AI infra.
