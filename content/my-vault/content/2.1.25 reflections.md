- rlly cute movie night last night :') 
- advice from justin re melody and mentorship: 
	- think of your value prop and the leverage ppl have in convos
	- eg the value you provide to a junior investor as a junior operator is low
	- junior investor to senior vc they have way more to provide u
	- you plant the seeds now but you dont talk to them until later
	- melody prob not in the ai infra space AND the companies are so early they may be too early for pm operators 
	- nextview has a lot of great portcos theyre just smaller since they focus on preseed
	- saying something like " i've been collecting thoughts on X and "
		- I'm focusing on the MLOps and compute space through my work on Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, but I think there are opportunities outside of the big providers. Happy to keep you updated on my thinking and where I land.
		- in these emails you should be DECLARATIVE and form some stance while being brief
		- be friendly
	- the truth is you need to go out and plant your seeds and write 10 of these exploratory emails and maybe 2 will have companies in their portfolio 
	- you just need to keep being aspirational
	- also reach out to talent recruiters at vc funds
- bids for attentin
