title: "beekeeper"

When my mom is bothered by a situation, see the emotions pass through her face like a thin veil. See her swallow her words, seal them back into the box sitting inside her.

Family trips are one part over-comfortable and two parts uncomfortable: in exchange for putting your Type A planning personality to rest, you must face the mirrors of all the quirks and sensibilities that have shaped you into your current form. 

There are bees buzzing inside the cage of our own being. 

I hold an incredibly short memory. Dates and names pass through my fingers, my cheeks flush as I try to recount a story whose details I've already mangled. Sometimes I feel more sieve than sponge, information passing through me without absorption. 

Other days, I carry a deep vacuum. Therein lies a dense gravity that yearns to consume, something, anything. Is it knowledge? Is it distraction? It's restless and endless. 

I'm pacing back and forth of the corridor of my mind looking for something that tells me I matter. It can't come from anyone except me. I worry for the days I'm apart from you, I confess. I feel purposeless.

*Purposeless?* You sound worried. *Without aim, more like.*

Aimless wander. This is what Thanksgiving in Paris feels like. *Flâneur*. In New York I take my phone out for walks. Google Maps, Beli, Tik Tok dictate my next move, my journey around the city documented by pins on the digital map. 

Here, connection is faulty and no path is straightforward. Instead of a grid system the streets run diagonal and cut at odd angles. We pop into random cafes and boulangeries to rest and my latent Type A prickles without the reassurance of a star rating to verify our choice. I soak in the scene, awash in diffuse amber stretching across floors of herringbone wood.

Late at night my time is mid afternoon for you, but never is it too early to recount our days. The names of streets and shops escape me. Among many things I appreciate about you, there's your own incredible memory, and your patience with my limited cache. I paint pictures in broad strokes, describing the tranquility of slow travel, the whimsy of wander. I love writing as a way to wander within my mindspace. Thoughts feel 3D in a way talking fall flat. How do I convert hyper-dimensionality into linear motion? The way I think converts beautifully in writing and comes out clunky in conversation. 

In short time you've become adept at reading me. There are moments when I slip behind the veil, lips pursed to protect reality from the bees within me. I fear articulating my own anxieties and insecurities. I prefer to hold a seed of doubt in my mouth, chewing it like gum. Turn it over. Inside out. Speaking it into existence guarantees its embodiment. 

Or -- it'll pop. It could also reveal that my worries are all smoke, no body. A friend, self-branded fellow overthinker, once drew a diagram to describe what thinking felt like. *This is the anxiety loop*, she explained, pressing the ballpoint into paper into a dense circle of squiggles. *Making art, writing, talking --* she draws a straight line rightward from a point on the circle, then draws an arrow -- *helps us release the anxiety and stop the loop.*

The diagram reminds me of physics class. The problems where a track star spins around in a circle, gathering angular velocity. The moment of intense pressure from built-up anticipation before they let go. Arms collapse at sides and air caves in the middle, cleaved by the straight line of 10 pounds of a metal discus. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm on a hamster wheel. Running. Always running. I've ran an average of four miles every morning this year, for fear of what'll happen when I stop. What happens when I let go? 

The days I come to you with pursued lips and endless runs on my mind -- you instantly know when something is up. I clam up when upset and I am grateful you pluck out my anxieties, to be punctured & popped by you.

from wenyixue: 
there is this physics problem i have never been able to understand: if you drop sand from an airplane in a vacuum, it falls in a straight line. i think we sometimes become our own vacuums, from our position, the sand does not move, it is a straight line. but the motion of the airplane and newton’s laws dictate that the sand moves with the airplane. the metaphor here being the airplane as time.

i told my psychiatrist once that i felt like i was stuck in myself, that i felt the same as i did at 16, that i felt i was cursed to forever be the person that i am. he said that he saw so much growth between the me that first entered his office and the me of now.

some scars take longer to heal and some scars never fade completely. between today and tomorrow, it may look the same to you. but the ache _will_ shrink because that’s what time does to all aches and even if you think the healing isn’t happening, it is beyond your sight.
