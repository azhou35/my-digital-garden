title: "product design template"

1. Define the problem space (ask questions about the background of the problem & company, first principles, target users, budget, metrics & goals) → use this to narrow your scope and identify potential areas to dive deep
    
    - "**What** is it? **Who** is it for? **Why** do they need it? **How** does it work?"
    - Digital v physical? Product or feature? Demographics?
    - Driving goals: (monetization, engagement, user acquisition & growth..)?
    - Specific customer segment/target market?
    - **State assumptions (e.g. US-specific) / ask if it's okay to make these assumptions**
    
    **[SIGNPOST]** Prior to next step, outline high-level of approach: Identifying users & pain points, prioritize pain points, choosing a pain point, brainstorm solutions, prioritize solution
    
2. Identify personas + customer/business value props → 2-3 personas of people with different use cases **+** value props for business/other entities
    
    - Identify the **needs**, **goals**, and **value props** for each of those personas/parties
    - For business goals/ needs, think short- & long-term. Think about metrics to optimize for.
    - **When doing this, be in-depth, specific, and product-agnostic when talking about user needs: show user empathy.**
    
    Pick one persona to hone in on.
    
    **[SIGNPOST]** List out your personas and the one you chose, and briefly summarize why. Then say you'll be moving on to thinking about user journey to identify pain points that we can zoom into.
    
3. Outline the user journey & Call out pain points
    
    - User flow, from moment they have an urge to do something, and every action from there on out
        
    - Example (for each of these areas, identify a couple things important to the user). One way to break down journey into a progression of:
        
        1. Acquisition / Activation Needs
        2. Engagement / Retention Needs
        3. Monetization / Revenue Needs
        4. Referral Needs
    - Product audit → go through each of those needs and evaluate: does product today meet these needs? "How would you improve XYZ"? What are you trying to solve at each stage in the user journey?"
        
        **[SIGNPOST]** After naming and detailing various pain points, summarize primary pain points
        
        - **Now, pick one area from the product audit needs, to focus on** (and justify this choice)
    
    **[SIGNPOST]** This first phase has been identifying pain points, goals, priorities. Summarize context & clarifications to lead into coming up with factors for prioritization of pain points & later, solutions.
4. Brainstorm solutions → come up with 4-6. Brainstorming frameworks:
    
5. **Reverse** the situation or existing process
    
6. **Why?**: Ask why & question assumptions
    
7. **Attribute Method**: list & mix/match attributes about the product
    
8. **SCAMPER**
    
    - **Substitute**: Replace parts of the problem/product/process → change things, places, procedures, people, ideas, emotions, etc.
    - **Combine**: Merge potentially unrelated parts of process/product OR ideas/goods/services
    - **Adapt**: Adapt an existing idea or solution to solve your problem → existing features, user flows, processes, resources, solutions from other industries
    - **Modify/Magnify**: Change or emphasize specific process, user base, market, efficiency, etc of product
    - **Put to another use**: Using this idea in other contexts, or other ideas in this context.
    - **Eliminate**: Reduce, remove, simplify components of process, product, features, user base
    - **Reverse/Rearrange**: Can parts of the process be done in a different order?
9. Prioritize
    

- Use 2x2 matrix (impact on goals x implementation effort, or others: _specific metrics, utility, feasability, desirability, monetizability, scalability, eng. efforts, nice-to-have vs crucial_)
- Think about each solution in terms of metrics I've mentioned

6. Choose a feature → tradeoff analysis for choosing one over the other
    
7. Measuring success
    

- Use action identified earlier (?)
- Quantify into 5-6 metrics:
    - Engagement → time-spent, referrals, shares,
    - Financials → transactions, revenue, profit
    - Productivity → high-value
    - Acquisition → (x per week) & Retention (churn)
- Define a "north star" → if this one metric goes well, we know the overall project is successful
- Experimentation & iteration
    - Focus groups?
    - Control vs sample (for A/B tests)

8. Summarize
