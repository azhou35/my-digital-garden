title: "nihilism of our generation"
---

ppl say things like : i dont want to bring kids into this generation.
in the era where economic opportunity and velocity is at its highest, the kids are not alright.

consumer sentiment is at an all time low. 
inequal outcomese between economic opportunity and curent jobs
ppl see agency and tik tok influencing as a way out of the rat race. people idolize influencing and people idolize building and we are all putting ourselves at levels of abstraction away from real life.
