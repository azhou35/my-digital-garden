final decision 
- decided to stay at microsoft and wait till promotion before leaving (aka not leave for scale)
	- deciding agaist working in defense, as the gen ai division is dying
	- even if there are still good oppotunities this is the following framework to follow
		- 1. company trajectory (strong growth traj)
		- 2. ppl / network
		- 3. domai expertise
		- 4. learn by doing (with autonomy)

i am feeling very empty and lost at the prospect of reneging scale and staying at microsoft. i feel stuck at my current job as a tpm and that i dont do anything useful. 
my boyfriend keeps trying to give me pep talks to put things into perspective, to trust myself, to put process over outcome. and that im in a great position to be 1 yr 4 months in a remote job where i have endless time to recruit elsewhere. 
but i just have this pit in my stomach that im gonna stagnate and microsoft and not learn. or continue to not do anything.
i hate bureacratic work and i want to learn by doing. i feel most alive talking to sharp ppl w a vision.

> _“Where are people solving the kinds of systems problems I want to solve, with the intensity and weirdness I want to be around?”_

i feel restless bc there are so many people on twitter who are doing great agentic things on twitter.

its been a while since ive felt satisifed with my days work.
i dont do anything that makes me feel stisfied after the days work.

i feel insanely disconnected from my work.

n urges me to be patient and that these decisions compound and i cant be spiralling every day. but i feel so restless. same way i did this time last year.

its bc i dont create anything
