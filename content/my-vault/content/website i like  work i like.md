Titles and disciplines are fickle and fleeting. But my work fits under the umbrellas of UX design, visual interface design, and DX (developer experience). With some cultural analysis, writing, and visual illustration sprinkled on top.

storytelling
When this year began, I did not expect to join an AI company. My primary interest has always been in human lives and the humanities: in the stories that help us understand the world and each other; in the literature and art that nourish our hearts and broaden our souls; in the intimate moral questions of our everyday lives. This desire to understand and improve the human condition led me to work in journalism through high school and college, to study political philosophy, and to eventually, unexpectedly, land in the startup realm.
> “The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation that is to come.”

> “The writer's role is what it has always been: he is a custodian, a secretary. Science and technology have perhaps deepened his responsibility but not changed it. In 'The Ring of Time,' I wrote: 'As a writing man, or secretary, I have always felt charged with the safekeeping of all unexpected items of worldly or unworldly enchantment, as though I might be held personally responsible if even a small one were to be lost. But it is not easy to communicate anything of this nature.'”
