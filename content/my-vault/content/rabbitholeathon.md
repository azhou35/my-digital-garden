- What are underexplored case studies of disruption in different fields (e.g. societal, cultural, technological, linguistic)? What are the effects of disruption on markets, on interpersonal relationships, or on technology?
- How does disruption happen? What are the drivers or triggers for disruption? How is disruption shaped by individuals, or is the direction and orientation of disruption inevitable?
- How have new mediums of communication, such as TikTok or podcasts, disrupted political communication? How might we understand these impacts in light of historical disruptions such as the introduction of radio and television?
- How do industries integrate new technologies, such as AI? How do those technologies reshape tasks for different jobs? What factors about a market or industry shape adoption, and how might we understand such disruption through historical precedents like the rise and decline of switchboard telecom operators?
- How do the disparate and delayed impacts of climate change disrupt local economies and traditional practices? How is climate change today shifting the balance of power and trade between nations, as some benefit from its effects while others are negatively impacted?


## 1.Tell us about some rabbitholes you revisit often
**Urban Design**
The way a city is designed can vary greatly from the way it's used. Dead space between buildings is used for plazas that perhaps no one uses. Neighborhoods that on paper have all the elements for a good public space - proximity to business centers, space, lighting - end up being unused. 
Case study in how we battled for congestion pricing in the U.S., examples of removing the bus fee in Boston, how Tokyo utilizes every inch of land, the housing theory of everything and how housing shortages affect other macro-economic outcomes like climate change, obesity, falling fertility rates, 
*The Death of Great American Cities*, *Cities for People*, *A Pattern Language*, *The Walkable City*

> I’m fascinated by the mismatch between how cities are _designed on paper_ and how they’re actually used. Some neighborhoods have every ingredient for a “good” public space — lighting, benches, businesses nearby — but remain eerily empty. Why? What makes a space feel inviting, safe, or worthy of lingering? I’ve gone down rabbitholes on the psychology of plazas, “desire paths,” and urban dead zones. I love comparing places like Bryant Park (which thrives) vs nearby “leftover” spaces that no one touches, even though they’re technically accessible.

**Linguistics/etymology**

1) I'm generally interested in how urban infrastructure shapes and is shaped by human behavior. Inspired by a study abroad moment in Copenhagen, I often return to how Copenhagen resisted car-centricism to become a biking city - how political uproar from citizens in the 70s sparked mini policy decisions like protected lanes and winter-heated paths.
2) Cooking from first-principles rather than following a recipe is what differentiates a chef from a cook. I'm obsessed with food media like *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat,* where they teach you *techniques* (like how salt breaks down proteins in chicken) over recipes (aka how much seasoning to actually use).
3) Words reflect thoughts, and a language in its sum mirror a culture's development. Any word is an inherent rabbit-hole - e.g., the origin of *tea* - whether "tea," "cha," or "chai" — reflects which trade route the good tea spread from China: “te” words traveled by sea, “cha” by land, and “chai” evolved through Central Asia. Or, how in Mandarin, emotional states are expressed through physical metaphors, like "angry" (生气, shēngqì) translates to "generating air." They in turn reflect values from classic Chinese philosophy like Daosim, and manifest in medical practices like acupuncture.  
4) 
It's a good foil for analyzing micromobility in NYC, whose current infra barely supports safe bike usage.
Cities are for people and how do the things we develop incentivize this? For example, policy changes in NYC materially affect one's everyday - congestion pricing has improved one's daily commute through Lower East side. The gendered experience of urban design is surprisingly under-researched, such as how certain patterns in their routine leave them susceptible to unsafe situations at night. Or how Copenhagen became so bikable, through environmental incentives, reclaiming car lanes for cyclists, and reversed 
The design of an city.

Etymology rabbithole - 
Words are reflections of a human thought, and a language in sum can hold a mirror to a culture's values, biases, and geo-political development. Any word is an inherent rabbit-hole - for example, the origin of *tea* - whether "tea," "cha," or "chai" — reflects which trade route the good tea spread from China: “te” words traveled by sea, “cha” by land, and “chai” evolved through Central Asia. 
Or, how in Mandarin, emotional states are expressed through physical metaphors, like "angry" (生气, shēngqì) translates to "generating air." They reflect classic Chinese philosophy like Daosim and Confucianism, and manifests in why Traditional Chinese Medicine incorporates acupuncture and the like.  

Our how in Mandarin, how many of our terms describing emotional state of being are rooted in physical symptoms (e.g. saying happy is the same as opening your heart!) There's the ongoing debate on how words capture a human's cognitive ability to express themselves.

## 2. On person-problem-fit. Where do you think your ideal intersection of person-problem-fit lies?
What problems do you care about? What problems are you uniquely positioned to tackle? Is there anything you've done already or want to do that you'd like to share?


I’m drawn to messy systems where small failures ripple outward and affect people. I’m fascinated by infrastructure in all forms: from how congestion pricing shapes supply chain dynamics in NYC, to the delicate plumbing that supports cloud technology. It's something core to my 9-5 - building supercomputers for a hyperscaler - and likewise fascinates me in everyday observations. Delighted by the unexpected patterns across systems, I find myself mapping ideas across domains, drawing from the humanities to inform the sciences.

What drives everything I do is this question: how does technology shape behavior and culture? Every system we build - from factories to cities - embeds human values and biases, and reflects them back into society. My work asks whether what we're building still serves what humans actually need. 

Writing is a tool to dissect a complex system and find the leverage points where small interventions can create positive change. It's also a powerful form of open-sourcing your thinking. Through my writing practice - from organizing writing clubs to publishing magazine pieces - I'm working towards a body of case studies that examine the gap between the values we think we're building into our systems and what communities actually experience.


Call me a generalist, a pattern-seeker, or just someone who notices the cracks — I’m drawn to messy systems where small failures ripple outward and affect real people. Having grown up with a heart in the humanities within a tech-focused environment, I I think of myself as a high-leverage generalist — someone who moves fluidly across the humanities to probe the sciences, looking for leverage points in complex systems where a small intervention can unlock deeper understanding or catalyze action, I want to take a humanistic pespective to identify where technology systems drift from human needs.




superpower — a way to take messy, abstract ideas and guide others through them. It’s how I make sense of systems that feel inscrutable: from urban zoning to 

I’m fascinated by infrastructure in all its forms: from how congestion pricing shapes supply chain dynamics in NYC, to the delicate plumbing that supports cloud technology. It's something core to my field of work - building supercomputers for a hyperscaler - and likewise fascinates me in everyday observations. I often find myself mapping ideas across domains to study platform incentives through a civic lens.

What drives me is the question: **how does technology shape behavior and culture?** What values are embedded in the way we build factories, train models, or design cities? I call this _socio-technology alignment_ — asking whether the systems we build still serve what humans actually need.

Outside of work, I cultivate spaces for cross-pollination: speculative writing clubs, photo walks, collaborative inquiry. This abstract inquiry is grounded in concrete community efforts. I run a speculative writing club and host photo walks that help people surface patterns in their environments. These are experiments in co-ambient presence and cross-pollinating ideas can help us build better shared models of the world.


Call me a generalist, a pattern-seeker, or just someone who notices the cracks — I’m drawn to complex systems where small failures ripple outward and affect real people. My ideal person-problem fit lies at the intersection of infrastructure, systems design, and culture — where technical and social layers meet, often misaligned. I think of myself as a high-leverage communicator: someone who translates ambiguity into clarity, especially when systems are opaque.

I’m fascinated by infrastructure in all its forms — from how congestion pricing changes logistics in NYC to how software supports supercomputing at hyperscale. My work builds on this curiosity: I help operate GPU infrastructure for AI at Microsoft, but I’m just as interested in how civic platforms or urban policy shape incentives.

Writing is my superpower. It’s how I make sense of the invisible — the values embedded in tools, cities, or models. I call this pursuit _socio-technical alignment_: asking whether the systems we build still serve what humans actually need.

Outside of work, I prototype community-based inquiry through photo walks, speculative writing salons, and cross-disciplinary gatherings. These are more than hobbies — they’re testbeds for surfacing patterns, building shared language, and reimagining how we live with technology.




I'm animated by questions of how technology shapes culture: case studies in how innovation changes behavior, queries on how we can design a better system to encourage human flourishing. My investigations are grounded by investing into my community and cultivating a cross-pollination of ideas. Whether it's through regular writing clubs or photo walks, there's a magic that comes through when you're invited to reflect and create with others. 





 I enjoy problems tha
I am animated by aesthetics and visual beauty. 
I enjoy running up and down the ladder of abstraction.
I care about 
- i care about intentional spaces to cultivate thought (aka more socratic seminars !!) and encourage co-creative activites. aka, writing clubs/photo galleries etc 
- as someone who is multidisciplinary i believe in cross-pollination.
- big picture patterns and tactical flows
- i naturally connect the dots across fields - spottig the weak signals that are overlooked by specialists
- animated by aesthetic and performance
- anti things: i dislike overly serious people / posturing

## 3, What do you plan on exploring at Rabbitholeathon?

For all the innovations in computing as of late, I'm still working to build a clear mental model of the physical nature of AI infrastructure. Supercomputers have an exceedingly simple definition: a computer that can handle high level of performance. But their impacts and implications are grand - historically powering weather simulation and complex physics equations, they're the engine powering large-scale AI training. There's some key dimensions I wish to explore that deserve a compelling narrative: the localized effects of datacenters on the communities they disrupt, with NOVA as a case study; how to sustain a convoluted supply chain amidst a delicate geo-political situation; how power and control of these behemoth computers flowed from government to universities to the hyperscalers.

I'd like to take a socio-historical lens to supercomputing, in a fashion inspired by *The Idea Factory* and *The Power Broker*. There are case studies and questions galore - who are the main villains and heroes of the industry, how can we align incentives for public good when these systems are owned by private companies, and oh my god, are we gonna run out of power? 

Looking forward, I want to investigate - what is the datacenter 2.0? Will it shift from rural to urban for hyper-localized centers? When attention shifts from training to inference, how will this disrupt these existing infrastructure investments? 

I want to explore supercomputing 
News of AI compute has gripped the news cycle - but I'm deeply curious on a socio-historical lens on the history of supercomputing, pre-dating its use case for lage-scale training. 

An example case study is examining the new data center, and how it can be built from first-principles given market, geo-political, and environmental pressures.
