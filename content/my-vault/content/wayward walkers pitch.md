title: "wayward walkers pitch"
---


My friend Simon and I both moved to the city last year and first bonded over going on photo walks and sharing our photos. Since then, we've held regular photo walks with new friends and slowly gathered a community of hobbyist photographers. 

We're starting up wayward walkers, an offline space for photographers to connect and share their practice. We're planning a pop-up photo gallery held at one of our favorite cafes, where we display photos by 3-5 photographers and invite the community to come mingle, meet other creatives, and chat about the vision behind the exhibits. 

Last year I attended the opening night for *Parallel Lives* and I've been yearning to host a similar event ever since! As a regular Land2Sea patron I'd love to use the space to host the first photo gallery for the hobbyist photography community. I envision us setting up an exhibit for a weekend (Saturday - Sunday), and having a gallery opening night Saturday for 2 1/2 hours, with a 1 drink minimum. It'll be a great chance to gather the photographers of the city. 

We'd love to host this sometime in early June!
