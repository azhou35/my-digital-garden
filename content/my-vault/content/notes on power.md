[]()the race for ai has become inextricability interwined with geopolitics
- how do we outperform china
- how do we disrupt their supply chain 
- how are the tarriffs going to affect ai 
theres a disconnect between the tannnins of a big ai system and the data centers that need to power it
Two key forces drive the rapid development of AI: 
Economic incentives for companies 
* The first companies to build AGI could gain trillions in value This creates pressure to move quickly, even at the expense of safety 
* Strategic incentives for countries Countries fear falling behind in a critical technology Military and economic advantages create a "first-mover" mentality
> - **Power concentration**: The ability to automate human labour concentrates unprecedented economic and political power in the hands of those who control these systems, risking a slide toward authoritarian regimes.

ideas:
* investigate the supply chain of a data center
* investigate the supply chain of a semiconductor
* investigate the supply chain of a gpu 
* water cycle metaphor 
research:
* hunger for electricity: data center power needs in the United States will triple by the end of this decade, jumping from 3-4% of total US power demand to between 11-12% by 2030.
* modern ai data centers: AI data centers are power-intensive behemoths, with server racks drawing up to 50 kilowatts each—more than seven times the power consumption of conventional data center racks
* power grid: Today's electrical grid is transforming from a centralized, one-way system to a more decentralized, flexible, two-way system that must balance supply and demand in real-time to maintain stability.
* Supply chain vulnerabiliies: bottleneck in distribution transformers, procurement for cables
* water: liquid cooling - Data centers use large amounts of water to maintain equipment, contributing to water pollution and scarcity in some regions
* Democratization vs centralization: dominated by Azure / GCp / AWS
* Community response: Mesa, Arizona, some politicians are now openly opposing the construction of data centers, framing their water usage as inessential and irresponsible given resource constraints

the power distribution of ai gains:
* three otpions:
	* one entity controls it
	* few entities control it
	* widely distributed control
		* permeated trust
		* -> is it like blockchain where it still skews towards the white male technologist? 
		* Defensive technologies might not outpace offensive capabilities 
		* Coordination problems among many actors 
		* May still result in power concentration to those with more starting resources
**Public deliberation** about who should control technology that could fundamentally reshape human civilisation
