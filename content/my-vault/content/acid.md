title: "acid"
---

how do i explain how i feel on this
* physical effects: hard to focus on image in front of me, my eyes kept changing shape, looking at nitin sometimes warped him
* this is what being on acid feels like: [Why do i never have anything to say? : r/socialskills (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9pblav/why_do_i_never_have_anything_to_say/)
	* i like cant entertain any train of thought for longer than an sentence
* it (among a few other things) blocks/messes with the pathways in the brain responsible for filtering things out before they're "perceived" consciously. Your brain is constantly overloaded with stimulus and thought, and in order to keep you sane it has a heavy unconscious filter (the thalamus) of what's "relevant" and "important" at any given moment.
* insecurities identified: 
	* im stupid???
* outside on the come up: i was dizzy and losing balance on the walk, noticing the trees and leaves and sky, but i was SUPER nauseous
	* it felt like the plane ride w shrey where i didnt wanna open my mouth and throw up everywhere and i was worried i ate too much from the burrito
	* on the park it felt short, but stayed out there long, noticed every little leaf
	* while nitin was telling me about his upbringing from his village to kuwait to america it felt like i was listening to my dad talk about his upbringing
	* i feel almsot guilty/ privileged
	* in the park lying down i did say i wish you were me sitting on your lap right now - a pure thing to say 
* during the music video:
	* intently observing the music video but i by myself couldnt piece together what was going on
	* had to wait for nitin to present his two possibilities and then i came up w my interpretatoin
	* holding the speaker and feeling the beats i could feel it inside of me
* really enjoyed making out nitin was def esp aggro
* i think i was a little overwhelmed by how hardo nitin seemed
* nitin telling me he loves me for the first time
	* ive been waiting for him to say it bc i never make the first move
	* and hes been thinking about whether to say it and the acid helped him think clearly
* talking w nitin in bed about our kids 
	* alania and dara 
	* nitin explaining the etyomology of alania (iranian kingdom)
	* him making fun of our kids for making the same contrived essays about feeling like theyre part of two cultures and how he dislikes identity politics like that -- i understand but i also used to do that
	* i think i read a lot but much like jaclyn i get the wrong conclusion
* him explaining how he hates networking bc he knows if you land the interview u will get the job 
	* whereas i think i will always leave it up to interpretation
	* eg post his convo w lisa post his convo w harley
	* even if ppl weasel their way into a higher position they wont actually execute, finds life incredibly meritocratic 
* i feel like the most intelligent comment i could muster was "i like this" or "i dont like this"
* pre dhamaka
	* nitin said he used to have the v and was pretty critical on himsefl
	* i think i just dont like being critical or negative and im a very glass half full optimistic person
* dhamaka:
	* worst part of the trip tbh
		* nitin was making jokes and i couldnt follow why they were funny, i just laughed bc i could tell they were supposed to be funny
		* i couldnt grasp what a fenugreek was 
		* i didnt like the first dish, i liked the last three, but i dont think it was the type of paneer i was expecting 
		* i fel so self conscious that i couldnt handle my brain in that moment 
	* 
* i think the high just lasted too long
	* i started it off slightly high
* part of me is worried about two things:
	* 1. during a conflict / feeling of sadness/anger/uncontrollable emotion i will struggle to communicate to nitin with how im feeling
	* 2. this experience has reaffirmed my fear that at some point we will run out of things to talk about bc i sometimes go along w the flow and will not be pushing nitin or showing him new things and he will run out of new things to show me and then we will need to find new things tg but he has done most of it 
* when we passed by kind regards he asked remember this
	* and i cant remember what he was referring to 
* there was a part of me in this week up to this trip that i thought i was smarter than most other ppl. this trip taught me that i am just as reductive and mimetic as the average person
	* i cant make generative comments about the food without having some sort of anchor on what other ppl think about it
* i feel not sufficiently self critical
	* i feel too optimistic about myself 
	* i do a lot of copium to believe that things will work out - but sometimes they dont and its a skill problem - and i can stay stagnant in the same place
	* i feel stagnant staying at microsoft and i dk what the path is out

* the limits of my language meant the limits of my world on acid -- i just couldnt describe what i was feeling 
	* **language is crucial to categorize & interpret the world around us -- i feel like i lost the words to do so**
	* there are different language worlds and under acid i was operating with a tiny subset of what i normally have 
* there is anxiety that comes from lack of control -- or does the llack of control result in anxiety 
	* suffocated by your own body
	* putting mind over matter is rough
* i wanted to start a convo thread bc i know socially thats what im supposed to do, but inherently it didnt come naturally
* i went from fine and lucid to relapsing in the restaurant
* i think i converse well when i can make connections between things and i just struggled to follow along w trains of thoughts in order to make the necessary connection
* i do want to try acid again and do it better and have more mind control i j wish there was a way to contro the nausea
* i had a dream where i transferred from cornell to another lib arts college
	* real grass is greener mindset
	* ate some ice cream

realizations: 
* i need to challenge and force myslef to explain what im reading or thinking sometimes
* a lot of times i will write it down and feel complete about the thought
