inspired by dan wang's breakneck
*who would i have been if i had stayed in china?*

hard to project the success of my parents but let's assume medium case outcome
i grow up
would i have still ended up in the ai labs? like deep seek?
i can't tell if im smarter or dumber than median chinese
would i have been working on chinese lab?
