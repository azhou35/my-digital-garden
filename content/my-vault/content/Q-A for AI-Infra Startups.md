title: "Q-A for AI-Infra Startups"
---

- **For infrastructure startups:**  
  *“I want to learn more about how your team is optimizing model inference costs without sacrificing latency. Are you experimenting with hybrid quantization strategies or novel hardware orchestration?”*  
- **For applied AI startups:**  
  *“How are you designing your ML pipelines to balance rapid iteration (e.g., fine-tuning for niche use cases) with scalability? Are you leaning on open-source frameworks or building proprietary tooling?”*  
- **For enterprise-focused tools:**  
  *“How are you structuring data pipelines to handle dynamic compliance requirements in industries like healthcare or legal, where LLMs face high scrutiny?”*
