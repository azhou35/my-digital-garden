title: "why im leaving microsoft"
---

Hey john, thanks for making the time today! know today is probably busy for you 

but I wanted to talk with you about something important.
i'll start with the bottom line up front: 
I wanted to let you know I’ve decided to leave Microsoft. 

now i know this may come as a shock given how the team has invested in my growth - This wasn’t an easy decision. I’ve learned a ton here — avross the team from you, mitra, nidhi, Aditya, partner teams like schie and aice etc. — and I really value the trust and autonomy you’ve given me. 

and one thing we rlly valued in our syncs is how much we talked about  prioritizing learning: and the past year working with a demanding customer with you and aditya has really put me in the rooms where decisions are made and empowered me with responsibilities that most new grads dont get.  

in the spirit of learning, I decided to take on another opportunity that feels like the right next long-term step for me in this space. I really wanted to tell you directly before anything formal went through HR.”

I’ve really appreciated your guidance — especially around how to work with customers and keep their trust. im plannign for my last day to be this fridaady - I realize that’s a shorter transition than ideal, and I really want to make this week count — documenting what I can, wrapping up ownership areas, and making sure things are in a good state before I go.

Let me jnow what the next best steps are, ive started to ramp up diego, and im committed to carrying out the planned maintenance we have this week on thursday. 

> “It’s another opportunity in the AI infrastructure space — similar focus, but a chance to work a bit closer to the core of the stack. I’ll be happy to share more once everything’s finalized.”

> “I’m genuinely grateful to you and Aditya for making that exposure possible.”

*if he says we need to end ip immediately*
i totally understand the hesitation but its important to stay through the end of the week at least until we do the handoff between me and diego 
“Totally understand if there are policies around that. If possible, I’d love to stay through early next week to make sure all the documentation, ramp-up, and Thursday’s maintenance wr


*why didnt u give us 2 weeks?*
- > “Totally understand. I wish the timing worked out that way too — but I wanted to make sure I could start the next role when they needed, and I’ll do everything I can this week to make the transition smooth. I’ve already started ramping up Diego and organizing handoffs.”

*reasons why leaving microsoft*
not a reflection of the team / scope of the work as i was very fulfilled 
- remote work 
	- ive never worked in person 
	- think its a valuable environment for someone early in career
	- appreciate microsofts flexibility but i think its hard to reap the benefits w a scattered/global team 
- learning
	- Honestly, it came down to timing and learning. I’ve realized I’m most energized by building close to where new capabilities are being developed — and this role lines up really directly with that. It’s not about leaving Microsoft; it’s about leaning further into what I’ve discovered I love
	- think i want to be
