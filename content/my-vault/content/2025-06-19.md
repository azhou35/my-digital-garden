hey helen! im working on ai infra at microsoft think im working on tangential problems that baseten is working on - would love to intro myself, trade notes, and learn more about what you're thinking on

hey adrienne - thanks for following along w my writing :)) rly bummed i couldnt make your nyc tech week event but the theme of *choosing to walk* really resonated w me - i've written a few pieces on resisting frictionless experiences and how important preserving attention is for cultivating artistic practices ([attention is all u need - by anniething & anniewhere](https://substack.com/@anniewhere/p-159944631) /[[random walks #01] digital & physical bids for connection](https://anniewhere.substack.com/p/random-walks-01-digital-and-physical?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2) / [friction as a fruitful endeavor](https://anniewhere.substack.com/p/friction-as-a-fruitful-endeavor?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2)). i think you'd also enjoy this substack [Make Something Heavy - by Anu Atluru - Working Theorys](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/make-something-heavy) and also "a philosophy of walking" by frederic gros that touches on similar themes.

hey annie, fellow annie in nyc here! i'm a independent cultural food photographer & writer who's passionate about highlighting those who have cultivated authentic spaces here in the city. i've been following your journey since king and been really excited about lei's opening, especially how you're subverting traditional wine culture through your chinese-inspired approach.  
i've been featuring these cultural wine bars as of late and would love to feature lei's story! (recently interviewed lai rai here https://offmenumag.com/sweet,-savory,-and-in-between-lai-rai-brings-hanoi's-old-quarter-to-the-lower-east-side)  
would you or your team be free for a quick chat about your inspiration, curation philosophy, and vision for the space? i'm happy to swing by any time in the next two weeks - let me know if you'd be interested!

Hey Annie! Fellow Annie in NYC here - I'm a cultural food photographer/writer focusing on authentic spaces in the city. I've been following your journey since King and I'm really excited by what you're cultivating at Lei, especially how its chinese-inspired approach is subverting traditional wine culture.

I recently featured Lai Rai (https://offmenumag.com/sweet,-savory,-and-in-between-lai-rai-brings-hanoi's-old-quarter-to-the-lower-east-side) and would love to tell Lei's story - particularly your approach to wine culture and curation philosophy. Would you be up for a quick chat in the next couple weeks? Happy to swing by the space!
