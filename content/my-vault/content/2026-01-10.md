Im ambivalent about scandium, I've alerted ppl yday and todayId like to get a start on c124 since today's “batched poc” went fine

huseyin 
experts running thru experiment
took the batch - 
started w a manual launch to observe the system
we've done w this one 
want to avoid manual recovery state
leaving the last one to kick off w the full automation
find issues and fix them
system is the first time we're trying

no end to end automation 

huseyin:
intentionally taken it slower to 
didnt see a lot of fallous 
300+ nodes
20 or so to be handled by backhand rules

out of the machines 
some failures
are we so go thru this 
if u put X in u get X-y out 
havent done the full tally on the full batch 
8 nodes go to UA due to ib problems 

we need to finish this cluster 
run one more experiment
