# Interview with Lai Rai Owners

**Annie (Interviewer, Off Menu Mag)**: I'm really excited. Yeah, I'm a big fan of Lai. I live in the area. I live in Faiasi, so I've been tracking your opening really closely. I stopped by a couple of times, so I was super excited to ask a few questions and learn more about your story.

**Joyce**: You're here with me and Gerald.

**Gerald**: Hello.

**Annie**: Hello. Hey, Gerald.

**Joyce**: Gerald is one of the owners and chef of Lai Rai. He's also one of the owners of Mom, our sister restaurant.

**Annie**: Awesome. Yeah, I really want to try out Mom too. I've heard amazing things about it, but there's always such a long line. You haven't been to Mom yet?

**Joyce**: That's great.

**Annie**: No, I haven't. I haven't. I'll introduce myself so you know where I'm coming from. I'm Annie. I'm a journalist working with Off Menu Mag, which is an independent magazine that's exploring untold stories in food and drink. I really wanted to feature Lai Rai because I thought there was such a cool story behind bringing an Asian-themed wine bar to New York. I feel like there's a cool niche that you guys are fitting yourselves into. And I think there's a lot of embracing of the culture that's going on here. So I'm really excited to learn more from you guys.

**Joyce**: Yeah, sounds great. Thank you so much for the kind words and for thinking of us.

**Annie**: Of course. I'll start off with a simple question. Could you guys tell me a little bit about your backgrounds in food and beverage and how that led you to starting Lai Rai?

**Gerald**: I have been in the restaurant industry for about... Damn. 17 years? I've been cooking Vietnamese food for about 10 years. I've been traveling back and forth to Vietnam since 2015. The shorter story of why we started Lai Rai with my business partner, Swan, who is a good friend of mine - I helped him operate his restaurant, D&D back in 2018. We opened till like 2020, 2021, maybe. At Mom, we can't get a beer, wine, or liquor license just because of close proximity to the school and church. There was a bunch of vacant real estate on this block, and he and I wanted to partner up and just do something fun as we both enjoy natural wine.

**Annie**: That's super cool. I'm curious, where did your interest in natural wine evolve? Was that just a natural effect of being in the food industry?

**Gerald**: For sure. The food industry, it kind of comes organically as, you know, if you're around it, exposed to it. I would say it skyrocketed for both of us through our travels through Europe. Natural wine is everywhere. And just having a small little wine bar with small bites seemed like a not too crazy concept as we both have two major projects that we work on - his restaurant being D&D and my restaurant, Mom. It seemed like not a super complicated project, one that we both enjoy: natural wine. Furthermore, the ice cream concept came from inspiration from a spot in Paris called Folerol that focuses on ice cream and natural wine. When we had it in Paris, I think it was two years ago maybe, it was just absolutely incredible. We were blown away by the pairing.

**Annie**: That's really cool. I feel like Lai Rai and wine is super unique. What were the kind of flavors that they had at the wine bar in Paris? And how did you guys decide to incorporate more Vietnamese flavors in Lai Rai's menu?

**Gerald**: That is an easy question. If we were going to be a Vietnamese wine bar, it's very important that we're serving Vietnamese flavors. It just kind of came hand in hand. Furthermore, using Vietnamese flavors that can sometimes tend to be savory - as you could imagine, Southeast Asian maybe doesn't enjoy their sweets too sweet. So it made it very easy to do earthy tones that I believe pairs well with the wine, like your avocado or banana leaf or Laughing Cow or chrysanthemum. The flavors at the wine bar in Paris were your Concord grape or chocolates. Just pretty well-done ice cream, very creamy, smooth. But the flavors, I would say at the time, they weren't super adventurous. I have made ice cream before at other restaurants, and it is something that I really enjoy. I've always seen ice cream as kind of like that blank canvas to explore and be adventurous with.

**Annie**: That makes a lot of sense. I remember I tried the fish sauce ice cream and also the Laughing Cow ice cream. These are both flavors that I'm used to because I cook with them a lot in savory dishes, but to have them in such a sweet form blew my mind, honestly.

**Gerald**: It was a lot of fun, right? It's an adventure.

**Annie**: It was super cool. Are there any fun anecdotes you have of sharing these fun ice cream flavors with people who may have not even heard of some of these things?

**Gerald**: I believe Joyce is more equipped to answer that. She works more directly with the guests.

**Joyce**: Definitely. I would say there's lots of guests who maybe aren't very familiar with a fish sauce flavor, so they might be a little unsure or hesitant about trying it, but once they do try it, they're super in love with it. I think that our fish sauce caramel has a perfect balance of sweet and savory. Hearing some names people might not be familiar with like cow cheese leaves, they're always curious to know more about it. All the guests that come in are always very open-minded and trying the different flavors we have, and they really are excited to support what we're doing. It's always fun when guests come in, never having tried one of these flavors and leave really loving it and wanting to come again, try the same thing or try other flavors and other foods that we have.

**Annie**: That makes a lot of sense. One question I also had when looking at the menu was, were there any other flavors that you thought would be cool to experiment with for the ice cream? Were you guys thinking of seasonal ingredients and a revolving menu of sorts?

**Gerald**: I do try to take the season as inspiration. As it gets warmer, maybe we'll see more of a sorbet approach, or if it's fall/winter, something more cozy. Again, trying to keep it not super stressful with a business at Mom, family - I just had a kid as well. So it's almost like a hobby and just kind of letting this project unfold organically. As I mentioned previously, I do love to explore with ice cream so when I do have time, I do tinker around with different recipes.

**Annie**: That's super cool to hear. Shifting focus more to the particular wines - I had two different Vietnamese rice wines on my last couple of visits. I'm curious to learn more about Lai Rai's relationship with those Vietnamese suppliers and the sourcing philosophy behind that.

**Gerald**: There is one Vietnamese supplier that is supplying us with Vietnamese rice wine, their company's name is Som Gai. They're good friends of ours. We have been in relation with them since 2017, 2018, 2019, somewhere around there. Every time I'm in Hanoi, I hang out with them. They're just constantly working and innovating on different projects. I think that what they do is very, very special. It's original, and it is definitely uplifting for their community in Vietnam, employing indigenous folk, and really changing their lives and giving them even some type of royalty for whatever product they may forge for their wines. They started off with gin. They have an Amaro out. Their two rice wines are two newer products that they had put out. The sparkling one in particular is their newest. And I think it might be one of my absolute favorites of theirs. Daniel and Yume and I are very like-minded, and I'm just constantly wondering what they're working on, visiting their laboratory and just kind of seeing what they're doing. It's been very inspiring. I learned so much from them.

**Annie**: I tried the sparkling one. It was so good. I'm curious, how would you describe how the Vietnamese rice wine is different than a regular rice wine?

**Gerald**: The sparkling one in particular, it's a natural style wine, so you don't typically see rice wine that is a pet-nat style where it ferments in the bottle. The fermentation happens naturally in the bottle, which is very, very beautiful. It has that color and taste almost like a grape or berry wine. It has those berry notes, and because of the purple sticky rice, it just has a beautiful color to it. It's just so original, it's so yummy.

**Annie**: It's absolutely delicious. I would love to buy a bottle if I could, honestly. It was so unique too. With business owners who have roots so tied towards Vietnam, do you see Lai Rai as filling a gap in representation within the wine industry, and is there a specific impact that you hope to have there?

**Gerald**: This is a two-part question. To answer your second part first - it's not for me per se to work for some type of specific impact. I think just doing what we do with integrity, love, and passion, whatever impact comes kind of happens organically. I think that's also the case for Mom and it's kind of how we operate our business. We're passionate about what we're doing. As I told you before, my partner and I really enjoy natural wine. I guess the community feedback - it's been really cool to kind of see how it has evolved. Especially among the community, they kind of use this as like a hub to maybe come celebrate or whatever it may be or do some type of artistic exhibit, maybe a food program or a book program that we just had.

**Annie**: I'd love to learn more about this idea of community and how you are trying to cultivate that in this space that you have.

**Gerald**: Again, if it happens, it's kind of organic. I don't think it's something that we're striving to do necessarily. Other than just being us and kind of letting our projects do the talking, I suppose. Through the experiences and making friends with people that come through, with regulars, new relationships, again, it just happens very organically.

**Joyce**: And I would say that this organic community that we've built and have been a part of, I think, has played a really large role in our bar. I'm so lucky to be part of so many diverse communities, like the local Chinatown and LA community, the Vietnamese, and Asian American community. We have a community of food lovers and food makers and wine enthusiasts. We're part of the community of small business owners. We have a community of creatives who we love collaborating with to host special events, like movie premieres, book launches, food pop-ups. I think a big goal of ours is to connect with these different special communities that exist. We really strive for Lai Rai to be very inclusive, inviting, and accessible as possible. We take into consideration the input and feedback that I get from our guests to always improve and challenge ourselves, to make this place as great as possible. We really do have such a lovely supportive community, which is the reason that we're still here. We receive so much support from the community and we always want to give back and contribute to it as much as we can.

**Annie**: I think I saw on the Instagram that there was a wedding or a proposal at the wine bar recently. I feel like that's such a cool way of using that space as well, having people have special moments there.

**Joyce**: Yes, exactly. Gerald loves having those events. We've had people celebrate weddings here, graduations, just lots of moments to celebrate life and community here at Lai Rai, which we always love to be a part of.

**Annie**: On the note of creating a space, I'm curious about if there were any thoughts behind the decoration and the interior design. I noticed there's special music playing as well as TV shows and movies playing on the white wall at the very back. I'm curious if there's any intention in terms of incorporating your personal heritage and experiences into the space.

**Gerald**: In terms of the visual decor, I think the inspiration came from that really older quarter in Hanoi with a Parisian vibe. Like the tan yellow walls, raw wash, the raw marble bar, like Indo-French architecture, streetside cafes in Vietnam. The guards, the Army green stools. In terms of the audio, Joyce is amazing at composing the soundtracks. And also the visuals, I believe Joyce is primarily curating that as well.

**Joyce**: Totally. For the music, that plays a really fun and special role at Lai Rai on top of our food, our wines, and our decor. Music is just another way for us to share this other aspect of Vietnamese culture that might not be very well known to most people. The music we play is all Vietnamese artists with songs spanning all eras going back to the 60s up until now with newly released music. The music covers all genres like Vietnamese new wave, Vietnamese Bolero, also called Nhạc Vàng. There's surf rock, folk music, punk, hip-hop. We have VP House techno, Experimental Electronic music, some ambient music. All the music that we play is a nod to all the talented Vietnamese artists who we really admire. Vietnamese culture has such a long and rich musical history that a lot of people might not know about, might not be familiar with, and it's still ongoing. It's really fun to be able to discover new artists, whether from the past or from the present, and be able to share it with our guests at Lai Rai. We also share on our Instagram and through a Spotify playlist so people can learn and explore more on their own as well.

**Annie**: That's awesome. Are there any particular favorite songs you put and played over the speakers?

**Joyce**: The music is always changing. It does change throughout service to kind of match the vibe and up the energy of the crowds around the night. A lot of the music, the artists that we play, is also projected in the videos. For the visual content that we project on our walls, we're also wanting to highlight these really fun Vietnamese creatives. We play snippets from this Vietnamese director we really love, Tran Anh Hung, who has directed movies like "The Scent of Green Papaya," "Cyclo." We project them onto the walls, we play music videos by Vietnamese artists that we really love, specifically from Paris by Night, which is a Vietnamese musical variety show. We play clips from music videos of artists like Ngọc Lan, really fun artists who have fun music videos with a very retro style from like the 80s or 90s. We also played clips of homemade video tours through different cities in Vietnam, like Saigon and Hanoi and Huế. It gives people snippets of what Vietnam looks like during that time, during that era of the 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s. It's really fun because people come in and say that feels nostalgic if they lived in Vietnam during that time, or visited Vietnam during then. But everything that we do - the music and the visuals and the food and the wine - we just want to give our guests a snippet into Vietnamese culture in Vietnam or bring it here to New York.

**Annie**: That's super cool. I definitely felt that sort of nostalgic vibe. I was there for a couple of hours and I noticed the music sort of shifting in its vibe throughout the whole experience. Stepping back a bit, Asian regions are not particularly well known for wine regions, but it seems like what Lai Rai has done is super cool in that it's capturing a bit of the Parisian vibe in terms of the interior design, but really embracing the nostalgia and beauty of Vietnamese culture through music and its flavors. I'm wondering if you guys had any comments or overall reflections on creating a wine bar that is typically a very European style thing and making it distinctly you and your identity.

**Joyce**: I think that every little detail that goes into creating this space does that. With the owners having visited Vietnam, being Vietnamese, having that influence, I think that leads into the work that we do. The guests that come in, a lot of them are Vietnamese and really excited to support what we're doing, but also people who are new to Vietnamese food, Vietnamese culture are also really open-minded in coming to support and explore and discover what we're doing. How this place has become what it is, has definitely evolved from every person that has had a fingerprint in this place - not just the people working here, but all our guests who come in and share this place with others, invite their friends and share about their stories and experiences with us. This place has come to be what it is from every person that has stepped foot in here.

**Annie**: That makes a lot of sense. I know it's still early, but is there any vision for how you see Lai Rai evolving over time? Are there any more aspects of Vietnamese food and drink culture that you hope to showcase in the future?

**Gerald**: I try not to look so far into the future, and just kind of let it happen day by day. Having operated Mom for the past three years, I don't think there's any predicting it. I do just obviously, as it's a business, hope for good success and the health of the business. And people to come and continue to enjoy our wine program and our snacks. Hopefully, in the future, perhaps we do have a slightly bigger team that we could execute, maybe more food, and just continue to grow our wine menu. But like I said, it's more of like a hobby, passion project. So it's kind of taking it day by day. I try again not to look so far into the future and have any types of expectations of what it could be.

**Annie**: On the topic of wine, how do you choose and curate the wine list that you showcase?

**Joyce**: We like to focus on natural organic, biodynamic wines and practices, independent producers, female and POC winemakers from lesser known regions. We also like to expand outside of grape wines and carry rice wines. For example, like Gerald is mentioning, we work a lot with Som Gai, based in Hanoi, who is the first 100% Vietnamese-owned distillery that focuses on sustainable agriculture, sources from longstanding indigenous farming families, and they really invest back into their partners in these rural communities. We also carry a rice wine by Hana Makgeolli, who's based in Brooklyn, and they're the first domestic producer of traditional Korean rice wine in the U.S. They use organic rice and traditional brewing methods. We have a Japanese sake by Akishika Shuzo, a sake brewer from Osaka, who grows their own biodynamically farmed rice and also ties up the process of crafting pure sake without additives. Putting together a wine menu is just wanting to highlight all the talented producers who we want to give a platform to and share with our audience.

**Annie**: I noticed there's Hana Makgeolli on the menu and that's also a place that I've been meaning to go to. So it's really cool that I would be able to experience that in a neighborhood that's only like 15 minutes from my home.

**Joyce**: Definitely, definitely.

**Annie**: I just have one last question. It's kind of a simple question, but I just want to hear from you guys, what does Lai Rai mean? What does the name mean to you?

**Gerald**: My wife picked the name, and it means several things. I think the literal translation is "little by little," which I think is a great example of the day by day mentality of not getting too far ahead or having expectations - like little by little it will grow. But it also has an expression of being like a little bit of food or a little bit of drink, not necessarily over-indulging, snacks here and there with some drinks here and there.

**Annie**: That makes a lot of sense. I feel like it kind of makes sense with the idea of enjoying your time with your companions and the guests who come in and the bartender and everyone just having a nice moment in the space that you're in.

**Gerald**: Nice.

**Annie**: That wraps it up for my questions. I really appreciate both of your times. I know you must be very busy, but it was super great talking to you guys. When I write up the story and get back to my editor, I can give you guys more details on when you can expect to see the piece out. This was a super helpful conversation.

**Joyce**: Sounds great. Thanks so much again for thinking of us. And yeah, keep us updated with how the story comes out.

**Annie**: Thank you so much, guys.

**Gerald**: Of course. Bye.

**Annie**: Enjoy the rest of your day.

**Joyce**: You too. Bye.
