  I’m a 23‑year‑old technologist who builds critical infrastructure by day and creative communities by night, and I want Interact’s community and
  accountability to help me wield technology with more integrity, historical awareness, and care for human outcomes.

i was a quiet child. growing up in a rambunctious family, i learned to observe my surroundings. It turns out that what I pay attention to became the core of who I am and what I value. As a street photographer, my interests are best captured by my photos, which document cities, memories, and people.
1) systems 
	- Infra / system / entropic decay
		- Infra is the silent undercurrent that goes undernoticed 
		- and it has so many consequences to society 
			- political 
			- behavioral 
			- economic 
2) Meaning making via photo / word / archival 
		- You practice noticing—preserving what would otherwise be flattened or forgotten. You’re resisting erasure at the scale of the self, the family, and time.
		- i gravitate towards the absurd, the intangibles memory
		- understanding our interiority / identity 
		- our background and how we came to be, honoring our family lineage and considering our dynasty 
		- storytelling / archival and how we maintain these failures / lessons is how we sustain institutional knowledge
3.  human ecology / lived social systems . community
	- anthropology / urbanism
		- Belonging / placemaking 
		- memory 
		- placeness
		- love ur city 
	- time and decay 
	- linguistics
		- and how they inform our behavior
- why:
	- - i'm keen on understanding the invisible that other people dont see or dont observe, growing up as a younger child who always watched their parents
I’m drawn to the quiet forces that structure our lives—systems, places, and stories that work best when we forget they exist—and to the ethical question of who notices, maintains, and decides what endures.

- What has been the biggest change to your beliefs or values in the past two years, and what caused this change? (250 words or less)
	- changes
		- Some people change 
		- Its ok to not have all the answers
		- Collect signals -> turn them into questions -> make room for the questions
		- What is ur infinite game
		- It all depends on the scoreboards by which you choose
		- Play can be seen as useless unless you are simply doing for the sake of doing
		- have the courage to be disliked 
		- you have natural compulsions that involve the problems you run towards 
			- gravity towards ideas you can't resist
				- corollary is that you will try to chase problems you think are interesting but it's not a form-function fit 
			- i realize that i like ambiguous, messy problems, systems level ideas 
		- there are multiple games 
			- all with different rules
			- and different constraints 
			- diff ways to *win*
			- some are 
				- zero sum
				- positive sum 
				- no real score board
				- sometimes to play is the game itself 
				- e.g. cite c. nguyen's games
					- Bernard Suits defines play as redirecting normally useful resources—logic, physical prowess, attention—toward activities that exist for their own sake. Play is only wasteful if you think outcomes are all that matter. A life optimized entirely for usefulness can end rich in resources and poor in meaning
					- . Optimization assumes we already know what matters and just need to maximize it, leaving no room to discover what we’ve missed. Play does the opposite: it invites wandering, tolerates confusion, and keeps us open to surprise long enough to learn what’s actually worth caring about.
				- career is the easiest game - its the most legible 
			- novelty vs endurance
		- questions are ok - 
			- i used to be defensive
			- but they are the natural way to extend convo
		- authenticity

	- catalysts
		- city moves
		- gaining confidence
		- validation 
			- finally getting the prestigious job i want and feeling empty
		- going from people pleasing -> not 
1.  From chasing legible scoreboards → choosing the game (alignment)
	1.  a game is about *play*
2. From people‑pleasing → authenticity (courage to be disliked)
3.  From needing answers → making room for questions
 I used to over-index on external validation.
 After a year of recruiting + getting OpenAI + I hit the empty *wait is this it* moment.
 Truly there are things I do for love of the game. 
     “empty” / “wait, is this it?” moment. One vivid detail beats abstract
     reflection. new value: alignment, picking the right game,
     leaving room for questions/play (Nguyen frame can be implicit; don’t name-
     drop unless it’s doing work). what changed in behavior: you moved NY → SF; you now
     choose messy systems-level work; you say no faster; you build community for
     its own sake.
catalysts:
- seeing how my mom used tech
- my mom in the hospital
- 

- Someone gives you $50,000 for a project that explicitly can’t be a business. What’s the project you work on and why? (250 words or less)

I would organize a data collection project focused on .  I would organize a small, non-commercial research initiative focused on augmenting on blindspots in our urban living data. I'm particularly interested in how different groups experience urban life - women, people of color, and the ill-abled community. 

These kinds of datasets require care and mutual buy-in from the community. NYC/SF collect their own data in order to inform their infrastructure/funding choices. When entire categories of life go unmeasured, systems can continue on without ever realizing there is a gap. We need legibile data to inform policymakers who make decisions on public safety; to guide problem spaces and products; to invite our neighbors to look out for each other. 
“[t]hat which we ignore reveals more than what we give our attention to. It’s in these things that we find cultural and colloquial hints of what is deemed important. Spots that we've left blank reveal our hidden social biases and indifferences.
Last spring i took part in the biennial tree census - a meticulous effort to count every tree across the parks of greater Manhattan. Not a true tree hugger, but I was fascinated by the care locals took to document the urban flora. Yet when setting up my own urban tech projects I found I was missing important informations - about X Y Z.

We live in a world saturated by data, but we've left crtiical blind spots.



Especially as we create models that are intended to map to the world, we need to make sure that voices are not left unheard. To ensure our mental models reflect reality, i'd push for  data that is 1) accurate 2) comprehensive 3) allows for nuance  
- Fixing mta
	- The commons
	- City but for ppl
		- how do we incentivize people to buy into their city? 
			- extension of coworking 
			- extension of exploring your city
			- -> reinvesting into your city 
				- examples of me doing this in nyc:
					- small businesses/storytelling
					- photographing/videoing nyc small businesses
					- coworking in various venues 
					- taking photos for local events 
				- using technology to improve our daily life 
		- better programs for 
			- cleaning up cities 
			- microbikes
			- walking tours 
	- Improving urbanism
	- there are infinite ways to self-collect data now 
		- According to Onuoha, “[t]hat which we ignore reveals more than what we give our attention to. It’s in these things that we find cultural and colloquial hints of what is deemed important. Spots that we've left blank reveal our hidden social biases and indifferences
	- What are my core values:
	- **library of missing datasets** 
		- The art research project The Library of Missing Datasets by Mimi Ọnụọha [Fig. 2], takes the form of a physical installation, comprising a traditional office filing cabinet that contains rows of manila file folders each labeled with the title of a dataset. Example labels include: ‘Total number of local and state police departments using stingray phone trackers (IMSI-catchers)’, ‘How much Spotify pays each of its artists per play of song’, ‘Master database that details if/which Americans are registered to vote in multiple states’. However, upon closer inspection, all of the folders are empty, and the labels actually describe datasets that do not exist. According to Onuoha, “[t]hat which we ignore reveals more than what we give our attention to. It’s in these things that we find cultural and colloquial hints of what is deemed important. Spots that we've left blank reveal our hidden social biases and indifferences.”﻿[4] In a data-saturated world, missing datasets signify exclusion and normativity, and they point to the power asymmetries that mask the advantage to some groups that certain data remains uncollected.
		- in spring i participated in the biennial tree counting project by the city 
			- participatory data collection 
			- census 
		- i would gather data for the hidden urbanism projects im curious by
		- e.g. feminism in the city - female data patterns 
			- e.g. from barcelona 
		- especially as we create models that are intended to map to the world, we need to make sure that voices are not left unheard 
			- e.g. in the past: decisions based on infra/housing/crime hinged on incomplete data -> biased algorithms 
			- e.g. what will world labs / physics labs based on if we dont have 
				- complete data on different types of races 
				- linguistic data on different languages
			- ensure our mental models reflect real reality 
				- Every classification system involves decisions about where to reduce granularity (census data cares about Asian versus Latino but forgets South Asian versus East Asian). You can't count something without first deciding what counts, and that decision is never neutral.
				- goal: data that is 1) accurate 2) comprehensive 3) allows for nuance  




- What project or initiative were you proudest of in 2025? What is your primary creative, academic, or work goal for 2026? (250 words or less)
	- project
		- photography

Outside of work, I write techno-social essays and curate creative spaces through Wayward↗, a project exploring how we create meaning, memory, and art in an increasingly digital world.

**project**:
wayward:
		- Wayward walkers  
			- We're starting up wayward walkers, an offline space for photographers to connect and share their practice. We're planning a pop-up photo gallery held at one of our favorite cafes, where we display photos by 3-5 photographers and invite the community to come mingle, meet other creatives, and chat about the vision behind the exhibits. 
		- subtle way to collect data:
			- asking for everyones favorite quote
		- Self‑expression has a tooling/distribution problem: high friction to ship, unclear standards, and algorithmic platforms
    that reward performance over craft
			- 
		- thesis:
			- if we hone our attention we can open ourselves to the joys of the world 
		- Following ur idle curiosity 
		- Noticing the signals of daily life and connecting the dots
		- Everyone yearns for self expression
		- Needs a space for play
	- inspiration: everyone is an artist and has a gallery of interests in their heart
	- 2026 creative goal
		- Go from wander -> focus
		- goal: building systems that endure 

next goal:
[[content/1-29 post-run thoughts|1-29 post-run thoughts]]
- publishing commons for creatives and technologists to combine their writing + visuals into polished outputs.
- Templates + constraints: a small set of formats that make shipping easy (e.g., “6-panel photo essay,” “2-page visual essay,” “annotated collage essay,” “micro-zine”).
  - Community protocol: repeatable cohorts run in libraries/cafes/community spaces: 4–6 sessions, peer critique, and a final “publish night.”
  -   - Tooling: a simple authoring workflow (Obsidian-first or standalone) that helps people combine writing + visuals into polished outputs with strong defaults (layout, typography, captions/alt text), and exports
    to:
      - print-ready PDF (zine/booklet)
      - web-ready essay page (scrollytelling-lite)
- some digital way for us to share our photos and images and see the resonance of our ideas outside of current sharing forms
	- it's localized media
	- i want to build a micro-community for my friends 
	- programmatic surfaces for us to share the attention we see the world

- Whose voice should carry more weight in the technology ecosystem than it does today? (250 words or less)
	- first principles vs grounded case studies 
		- its easy to look to the future and harder to look to the past
		- the best way to see what tech can do is to observe the casaulties 
	- i want to celebrate the *stewards* as much as the *builders*
		- who enforces longevity?
			- e.g. open source enforcers 
			- the hackers who are improving X Y Z technologies (e.g. obsidian)
			- the people who are repairing and maintaining our physical infra 
	- Invisible labor on the ground who actually implements and is affected by technology 
	- The people using the tools 
	- E.g. why are the tools for service ppl so backwards
	- E.g. pilot ppl and anyone operating machines 
	- materiality of digital networks. In other words, systems that appear to exist in clouds and other immaterial spaces are always rooted in invisible yet very material infrastructures. For example, internet servers take up hundreds of squares of space and tasks like cleaning the internet of inappropriate content is typically accomplished not by algorithms but by workers in the Global South. We often discuss the sanitary or sustainable city, but how about the sanitary digital world? Is the invisibility of digital cleaners different from the invisibility of other types of maintainers? What is the emotional, physical and psychological toll that these workers experience? Turns out that clean streets as well as clean digital networks rely upon the invisible and displaced labor of marginalized peoples

i want to incentivize us to be stewards of a community. care about maintaining things such that they last, rather than to always be building something. 

- if applied last year What has changed most for you since your last application? (150 words or less)
	- 

- Wayward wander 
- Photo community
- Photo gallery
- Photowalks
- studios
- Following ur idle curiosity 

meta:
- how do i make sure to ground this in interacts ethos of techonlogy and becoming stewards
- if infrastructure is made invisible, who and why makes maintenance invisible? Whose bodies are exposed to dust, darkness, chemicals, and third shifts? How does a language of care transform discussions about infrastructure? 
random ideas:
- i remember rudra benjamin and reading cities for people
	- and how she mentioned benches were deisgned to be anti homeless

Hey team - we're working on standardizing requirements to our CSPs to help towards goal of 3P Platform Convergence, in order to minimize toil in operating the ever-growing fleet.

This is the first draft and we welcome additional opinions - please list any and all experiences so we can capture a full picture of our experiences.

Once reviewed, we plan to share with our providers during our meetings/off-sites in Feb and drive their roadmaps towards solving our problems. 

We are working on standardizing requirements to our CSPs to help towards the goal of having minimal divergence and toil in operating and monitoring our evergrowing fleet. Please review and provide inputs to this draft of requirements. We plan to share with our providers next week once finalized in order to drive convergence."

Then we should be able to figure out:
What is the fastest path to solving the problem?What do we need to do?What do we need from them?Which CSP is missing what we need?
