Questions:
1. what is the problem our community is solving? 
	1. creatives are lost and want places of play and "wandering" where they can experiment 
	2. new grads are lost and looking for hobby-based community / feel disconnected from society 
	3. we want a way to document our way of seeing the world/travel/ideas and also a way to share, but we're overloaded by ig 
	4. thinkers need place to share their ideas
		1. thinkers need place and accountability to develop our idea
2. gtm 
	1. videos (tik toks)
	2. interviews
	3. vlogs of photowalks
3. design 
	1. brand 
	2. what CONCEPT are we selling
4. themes
	1. nostalgia, creativity, exploration 
	2. experimentation uncertainty
5. taglines - 
	1. Wander the city with a new lens. 
	2. Sunday afternoon photo walk through the Village. Bring film, we're finding the light.
	3. Slow down. Look around. Document what you see
	4. Creative adults in NYC lack analog, intentional spaces to make things and connect


concepts:
- shared photo book 
- shared zine 
- shared video 

my concerns: 
- we lack a coherent focus / concept 
	- e,g, "cafe for asian danish pastries"
	- 'dj set'
- are we providing a space? a concept? a vibe? an exp? what is the incentive to come here? what would make ppl pay for this? 
	- we need physical products - zines, merch, etc
	- our an experience, or convos 
differentiators:
- unique wedges in photography + writing 

my goal:
- build my own personal brand as a tastemaker and community gatherer 
- attract a network of folks who are intentional, artistic, easy-going, extroverted 

things to make:
- website
- videos
-
