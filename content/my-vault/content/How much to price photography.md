Considering these factors, a reasonable range for a wedding with 15+ people might be:

- **Basic Package**: $800 to $1,200 for a basic package, covering around 6-8 hours of coverage and delivering a set number of edited photos.
    
- **Standard Package**: $1,200 to $1,800, which might include additional hours, more edited photos, or extra services like an engagement shoot or a second shooter.
    
- **Premium Package**: $1,800 to $2,500 or more for extensive coverage, higher-quality prints or albums, and additional perks.
