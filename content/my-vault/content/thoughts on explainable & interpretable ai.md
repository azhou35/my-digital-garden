> explainability-performance tradeoff - how explainable can something really be


ml researhc has gone kind of sour on explainable ai

One group sees ai performance being hampered by explainability and the other thinks it’s the key to adoption

how do we design ai systems that is human in the loop, provides explainability and interpretability and deals with these tradeoffs?

i think i am passionate about explainable + interpretability in data.
not necessarily interpretability in the backend of a llm, but interpretability in data flow thruout an org.
