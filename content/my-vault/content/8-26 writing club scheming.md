title: "8-26 writing club scheming"
---

post run w justin
why am i doing this?
*bc i felt so fulfilled when we set up that bookbear hang*

ICP:
* introspective tech-y ppl who care about writing / culture / community 
communities/brands to look up to:
* 

market map:
* writing clubs
	* [Olive Tree Writing Club (@otwc_nyc) / X](https://x.com/otwc_nyc) 
	* open book club
* literary spaces
	* [Events — Yu and Me Books](https://www.yuandmebooks.com/events)
	* poetry events/open mics ive gone to 

twitter content strategy:
* post more writing shit 
	* poets/writers i enjoy
	* random words i enjoy 
	* things in diff languages
	* my own writing
	* meta writing tips

substack strategy
* write a collab post
* start a chat

moon shot ideas:
* do a hang where ava / famous substackers show up
	* invite famous-ish ppl to our writing hangs -- my parents reminded me to follow up w this family friend lol [JENNY XIE - Home (jennymxie.com)](http://www.jennymxie.com/) or Brian Truong
		* we provide them community & audience, they provide us high value writing lol and an opportunity to go into writing prompts re: identity/culture
* zine / publication with all of our writings
	* launch party
	* idk any real value out of this outside of hubris lol
	* could collect writing related to a theme? eg "loneliness", "friendship", "love"
* "inktober" challenge but for substacks
	* write one post every day of october 
	* mutual challenge where we could try to make a trend across substack 
	* culminates an event for all the ppl who completed (cuz flop and just be an inner circle hang, which is cool too)
*  partner w startups building in writing / content 
	* im personally invested in what the future of writing / content looks like and i want to build this community with this in mind 
	* [James Yu | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesyu/)
* go down the media/advertising/nyc business route
	* writing clubs at cafes (get some traction for small cafes, charge $10 for a coffee & pastry in exchange for writing time, seen this model at a couple of places)
