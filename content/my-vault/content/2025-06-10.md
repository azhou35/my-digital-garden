substack ideas:
* how to be authentic
	* you have a true self to discover but in reality identity is constructed thru choices and relationships
* in defense of small talk
	* casual interactions build the social buttess to catalyze depth
* choice is freedom 
	* choice oveload leads to decision fatigue and regret
* effiency is everything
	* counterfactual: optimize time/energy to maximize life satisfaction
	* but inefficiency creates serendipity and emaning
* how to leave friends behind
	* there is an expectation for catharsis when you reconnect with old friends
