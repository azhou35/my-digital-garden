title: "post zain coffee reflections"

YOU are the third space
* instead of going to coworking events, zain has a weekly ritual of going to the same coffee shop and has an open invite on his personal website (abraco @ 8)
	* putting your self & your own work as priority over meeting ppl for the sake of meeting ppl
	* no one shows up -- but what about the beauty when someone shows up?
	* reminds me of "standing office hours" where me & sean would work in duffieldhall and work on our own thing, but other ppl are invited to pull up and debug tgthr 
	* 2.5 space ?? 4th space ?? personal-shared space??
	* constraints: you prioritize yourself so you choose a coffeeshop near you, and a time convenient for you, and *you show up*
		* i'm very bad at following rituals (like going to church LMAOOO) bc if i dont wanna do something ill just not do it? living in fidi is also a barrier few ppl will actually pull up
		* maybe - i can pose this open coworking invite to my friends (wednesdays @ black fox, perhaps?) and detach myself from the expectations of anyone showing up
	* how i work best: when its a casual hang where we both show up and we dont feel pressured to talk too hard w each other
		* i like it when they ALSO wanna be there. sometimes i feel bad asking to cowork together bc i can tell they don't 100% buy into the idea of coworking
on taste & focus
* when zain finds something he likes (mucisian, artist, movie) he will cover their entire discography / song list --> and then create an opinoin. i think i form my positive opinions too quickly (omg i LOVEE this song)
	* his suggestions: amc + 
		* watch: perfect blue
on cooking in nyc
* why half ass it? the constrains are hard (roommates, tiny kitchen, space, time) and there's so many good restaurants in nyc. foucs on eating good food now, and then spend time cooking later
recommendation on podcast:
* all abot this company's episode on microsoft
