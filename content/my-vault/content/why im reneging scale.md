title: "why im reneging scale"
---

framework for where to jump to next
1. join a rocketship
	1. scales growth is tapped out or questionable 
		1. gen ai is definitely not growing (2/5 contracts are pulling out)
		2. defense is next place of growth but uncertain if it will deliver 
2. join where the talent is
3. join on domain for compounding knowledge
	1. definite misalignment between what i do and what they do 
4. join where you can move w autonomy

scale doesnt match up with a domain for compounding knowledge.
i think theres a lot to be done in healthcare, ai infra optimization, even fintech,
clearly i really admire the talent at scale and the work to be done. there is just too much uncertainty and i think there is a different rocketship to go after.
