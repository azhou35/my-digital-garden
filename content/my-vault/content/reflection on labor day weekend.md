* reuniting with old high school friends 
	* but we're not rly friends, we're not reuniting

	* want to follow up w mary and reflect on our relationship or send general good will 
* porter robinson 
	* oMG so euphoric owkey even dry 
	* all the texting-based visuals was beautifulll such a great fusion of tech x art
	* connie: porter's said the sky is the type of art that makes you want to create art
* art vs aesthetic
* sister loved porter robinson, feels like she passed down to me
* will and lyndon loved porter and i feel like i got tha
	* i realized my friendship w will rly was pure -- we did understand each other on a level that the other people dont understand -- i feel like no one at this reunion rlly understood my mind set end of high school or even throughout high school
	* i think in a way 2020 look at the sky -- will and lyndon were my anchors in a remote environment
		* and things exploded before i left for college and had a new start anyways 
* dc museum: play of words 
	* 1st wed of the month
