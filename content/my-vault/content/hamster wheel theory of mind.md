* when i overthink, i rabbit hole myself into vicious circles
	* the deeper i get the more entrenched i become in feeling hopeless, insecure, overwhelmed, etc 
	* -> pressure builds when negative thoughts compound
* dynamic activities (writing, running) are the only way for the thought to escape the cycle and escape from my brain 
	* why do i run? why do i write? as a means to get away from myself 
* my bad habit is i will tumble down this staircase and only let ppl know i was stuck only after i exited 
	* writing my problems out > speaking
	* but speaking is an opportunity for a 3rd party pov to push back on some of our biases/insecurities
* thinking from point a -> b knowing that i want to arrive at point b
	* VS thinking at point a and leaving myself open to any point b c d e 
* we exist in prisons of our mind & swaddle ourselves with schemas
* self mythologizing - is crucial but also dangerous
	* we construct these pre-determined labels in our mind 
		* in the past i did X so I must be Y
	* they're crucial for identity coherence but could also be self-limiting - the way 
* anxiety loops --how to unwind 
	* expeiencing anxiety about smething and then avoiding it
* existential anxiety
