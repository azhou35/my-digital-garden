overall core of story 

### ==everyday annoyance is a signal for progress w/o resilience==

==For all the technological progress in the past fifty years, it also appears that the ground is splitting apart beneath our very feet. gas / food prices getting higher, commute getting worse, daily cruft increasing. we experience death by a 1000 paper cuts.==

==Why does it feel like the world is falling apart?==

==Our culture's go-to icebreaker is to gripe about our commute. How consistently delayed the flight from JFK to SFO is; the constant potholes in the LAX driveways. In the past month, i've taken five flights. 4 out of 5 have been delayed. one flight from la to sf that takes 1 hour was delayed 4 hours. why? because the preceeding flight before it was delayed, and the one before that.==

### our systems are invisible and inept models of the world 

We perceive our systems as broken. In reality, we have made them invisible and modeled them incorrectly. 

Infrastructure powers our world - the X Y Z. These systems self-organize and control processes in a self-regulating loop. Infra is unsexy - when we look at a building, we first admire the craft of the architecture and design, and rarely consider the supply chain logistics and utility grids that birthed it to being. It's a feature not a bug: our power lines and transportation systems are designed to be unnoticed. 

Even the software we depend on everyday is backed by physical DCs in NOVA, networking cables, etc. yet we have no conception that every inference call to ChatGPT or Google query triggers a careful orchestration of X Y Z. *Abstraction widens the gap*: we have software-level expectations - instant gratification - to utilities and services with real world constraints - e.g. the powerlines that give us reliable internet. 

Software has softened us with a friction-less life. Instant response. Infinite retries. We then project those expectations onto our daily lives - expecting instant trains and constantly operational busses. But these systems operate under real-world constraints.

The gap is widened as we optimized systems for efficiency. In construction projects we cut corners and squeeze out costs, chosen optimization over resilience. As a result, systems become tightly coupled and have no room to fail. But efficiency cannot eliminate risk - it merely pushes it downstream.

The lynchpin of these sequence of active choices is *entropy*: the notion that systems drift toward disorder unless energy, attention, and feedback are deliberately applied. There are two headwinds here: life is getting more chaotic at the same time our systems are becoming more tightly coupled. Our worsening climate situation means more hurricanes/earthquakes/storms to strain our systems, and globalization and progress has made intrasystem interdependence such that when when one failure point fails, the effects travel fast. A disruption in one place now ripples across industries elsewhere. 

And this is why it feels like our world is falling apart: the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is crumbling beneath our feet; [flight delays cascade thanks to outdated air control systems](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5424682/air-traffic-control-overhaul). The truth is that our bridges and airports are beyond their expected life span, and yet we cannot sustain the impact of taking these out of our system.

Collapse looks sudden, but the damage has been accumulating quietly for years. 

### bring it back to the individual 

growing up i was fixated by *the butterfly theory* - that the flap of a wing in X can impact weather in Y. life is all about the ripple effects of a single action and the messy problems and unfinished answers that emerge.  

I measure out my life with public transit options - day trips to New York marked by long 
why me? im a public transit nerd beholden to the whims of the mta. grew up with parents who were public transit nerds - being from a town where everyone's parents commuted into the city, we were abundantly aware of the quirks of the nj transit. (so much so, that my mom had a brief stint there as a software engineer). we spent weekends taking the path train into world trade center, back when it wasn't a beautifully ornate marble structure but just a box under construction. moreover: i'm motivated by systems-level thinking, choice theory, as well as the way it shapes our behaviors. 

I want to study the systems, infrastructures, and networks that make up our world. 

This essay marks the beginning of a new strand of this newsletter, which I’m calling *entropy*. It exists as a place to look closely at the systems that govern everyday life, and at how years of overuse and strain have pushed them toward their limits.

In the present, that means understanding how systems came to be and how they function today -- why is the NYC metro constantly late? 

In the past, it means examining how systems like factories or infrastructures failed, the signals we missed, and the writing on the wall. 

The future means grappling with *what comes next*. As *Gradient Journal* puts it, "within our lifetime we will have to figure out how to rethink the way American settlements are made and how they operate. We have to rethink how we get our water, how we get our power, and how we store and transmit it. We have to rethink how we move, how we eat, how we govern ourselves. ***All of this is necessary because it’s clear that the design standards of the infrastructure we have did not contemplate the climate we are now living within***. Much of our current infrastructure is too fragile or brittle to survive."

Infrastructure is not only technical - it's social and institutional.It is infrastructure is built for our communities and should mirror the social structure it servers. We share water with our neighbors. We rely on our local hospitals for vaccines and care. When infra and communities drift in different directions, we need ongoing recalibration to keep incentives, policy, and construction pointed in the same direction.



I want to study the systems, infrastructures, and networks that make up our world. 
im curious about these questions:
- what are the emergent risks when unknown variables collide? 
- what are the right signals to propagate across different stakeholders to ensure action and proper handoff

And thus I begins a new variant of this newsletter, entropy. Through this newsletter, i want to shine a light on these systems that that govern the world, and how years of over-use and strain are adding pressure to their constraints. 
- the goal of focusing on this as a topic: 
	- look at the case studies of infra in our life in the 
		- present
			- how they came to be, how they evolve, how they influence our every day decisions 
		- past 
			- why they failed
				- eg flint water proj
		- future 
			- what can we do ? 
			- from [[content/infra - gradient journal]]
				- "There’s a great opportunity here related to urban technology. I personally believe that within our lifetime we will have to figure out how to rethink the way American settlements are made and how they operate. We have to rethink how we get our water, how we get our power, and how we store and transmit it. We have to rethink how we move, how we eat, how we govern ourselves. All of this is necessary because it’s clear that the design standards of the infrastructure we have did not contemplate the climate we are now living within. Much of our current infrastructure is too fragile or brittle to survive. Where is that reinvention going to happen?"
	- the people within it all
		- Lest us not forget the human, institutional aspect of it: infrastructure is built for a community and should mirror the social structure it houses. We share water with our neighbors - we get vaccines from our local hospitals. When infra and communities drift in different directions, there's a consistent calibration period to keep incentives aligned and maintain policies that steer construction in the aligned direction. 

	- general infra rabbit holes
		- I also want to investigate how technology in the context of urban development  -- such as apple pay on subway stations, last-mile bike apps for micro-mobility

materiality of digital networks. In other words, systems that appear to exist in clouds and other immaterial spaces are always rooted in invisible yet very material infrastructures. For example, internet servers take up hundreds of squares of space and tasks like cleaning the internet of inappropriate content is typically accomplished not by algorithms but by workers in the Global South. We often discuss the sanitary or sustainable city, but how about the sanitary digital world? Is the invisibility of digital cleaners different from the invisibility of other types of maintainers? What is the emotional, physical and psychological toll that these workers experience? Turns out that clean streets as well as clean digital networks rely upon the invisible and displaced labor of marginalized peoples


 the world is built upon systems that organize and control processes in a self-regulating loop. at the same time, it relies on infrastructure, especially public and private, which enable activities. they act as systems that hum in the bg, quietly and thanklessly shuffling us from one place to another, housing us, feeding us. academics, practitioners, and users, claimed that infrastructures become visible only when they crumble and fail. *In other words, infrastructures are meant to be invisible* and we are intended to erase the maintainers and practitioners who maintain it.

Even the software we depend on everyday is backed by physical DCs in NOVA, networking cables, etc. yet we have no conception that every inference call to ChatGPT or Google query triggers a careful orchestration of X Y Z. infra is very different than software: the goal is to sustain and endure. but we have software-level expectations - instant gratification - to utilities and services with real world constraints - e.g. the powerlines that give us reliable internet. 

when we treat infra as invisible, we render ourselves helpless to the consequences of entropy: the notion that systems naturally drift toward disorder unless energy, attention, and feedback are deliberately applied.

however, our systems increasingly rely on abstractions that scrub away physical limits, labor, and edge cases. when we model our world as a series of inputs / outputs, we assume static variables and normalized conditions that deteroriate in reality. 

in a bias to overoptimize for everything we have given systems no room to fail. efficiency procrastinates risk, punts it downstream where is is felt by the next link in the chain. in perfect conditions this works great - but there are three harbringers of collapse: 
1) life is getting more chaotic
			- eg natural disasters
			- eg more complexity in our systems -> more intersections/collision points -> more failure points 
				- as a corrolary more things depend on each other - so when one thing fails its more disastrous
					- butterfly effect - a fire in town X can cause ripple effects in industry Y 
					-  And thus when something goes wrong at point A, it quickly propagates at a cascading rate. 
					- overreliance on centralized hubs
					1. When one node fails, entire industries stall
2) efficiency accelerates entropy if it disallows friction/buffers/redundancy
			- system designed to run perfectly has no room to absorb shock 
			- when stress arrives collapse looks sudden but its been accumulating invisibly
3) our own instiutions have not caught up. 
	1) im also interested in digital infra and the self organizing we do to push back against inevitable decay
		- micro organizing 

- everything in modern life seems to be falling apart
	- by all means we've leap-frogged expectations for the UN's top values for living (in health, age, etc) 
		- we build better and grander construction projects  
	- yet there's this cognitive dissonance we hold 
		- gas / food prices getting higher 
		- commute getting worse 
		- daily cruft increasing 
			- death by a 1000 paper cuts 
		- life feels harder not because we’re failing individually, but because the systems underneath us are degrading.
	- as we move towards a more software-focused world 
		- we easily lose grip of the physical nature 
			- naturalized to expect 1-day shipping and on-demand zoom therapy 
			- We expect physical systems to behave like software.
				- but it cant
				- our field of vision has become narrower as we expect software-level reliability/speed/performance out of infra-based reality

### infrastructure behind it all 
- 


i've been circling around rabbit holes on infras, across urban and compute. 

this is a newsletter that focuses 

im curious about these questions:
- what are the emergent risks when unknown variables collide? 
- what are the right signals to propagate across different stakeholders to ensure action and proper handoff
- 


- modernity means we're watching a car crash in slow motion 
- (insert this is fine meme)
	- examples: the mta relies on transformers that are on the brink of exploding
- -> in a bias to overoptimize for everything we have given systems no room to fail 
	- three tailwinds/harbringers of collapse:
		- life is getting more chaotic
			- eg natural disasters
			- eg more complexity in our systems -> more intersections/collision points -> more failure points 
				- as a corrolary more things depend on each other - so when one thing fails its more disastrous
					- butterfly effect - a fire in town X can cause ripple effects in industry Y

		- efficiency accelerates entropy if it disallows friction/buffers/redundancy
			- system designed to run perfectly has no room to absorb shock 
			- when stress arrives collapse looks sudden but its been accumulating invisibly
	- im also interested in digital infra and the self organizing we do to push back against inevitable decay
		- micro organizing 
- infra, institutions (media/unis/democracy), platforms (social search streaming)
- 


- 
	- why me?
		- im a public transit nerd 
			- my favorite quip is that i can't drive & i can't pump gas, so i'm destined to be a defender of public transportation.
			- i grew up with parents who were public transit nerds - being from a town where everyone's parents commuted into the city, we were abundantly aware of the quirks of the nj transit. (so much so, that my mom had a brief stint there as a software engineer). 
			- they'd tell me about the latest ferry lines popping up in some random town in new jersey, projecting the upward housing market value it'd bring. my dad would tell me about all the latest nyc urbanism projects: the highline, seaport south, big island. 
			- we spent weekends taking the path train into world trade center, back when it wasn't a beautifully ornate marble structure but just a box under construction. 
		- i like thinking in systems
		- i like choice theory 
			- video games are all about the ripple effects of a single action 
				- played life is strange etc 
		- i gravitate towards messy problems, unfinished answers.

thesis:
this is a newsletter looking at the systems that govern the world, and how years of over-use and strain are adding pressure to their constraints. 

from *thinking in systems:* systems naturally drift toward disorder unless energy, attention, and feedback are deliberately applied. 

- failure = physics + delayed physics + human impatience
	- eg we misread signals, pull the wrong levers, overcorrect
- entropy occurs when
	- feedback loops drag
	- incentives misalign
- efficiency accelerates entropy if it disallows friction/buffers/redundancy
	- system designed to run perfectly has no room to absorb shock 
	- when stress arrives collapse looks sudden but its been accumulating invisibly

why me:

my favorite quip is that i can't drive & i can't pump gas, so i'm destined to be a defender of public transportation.

i grew up with parents who were public transit nerds - being from a town where everyone's parents commuted into the city, we were abundantly aware of the quirks of the nj transit. (so much so, that my mom had a brief stint there as a software engineer). 

they'd tell me about the latest ferry lines popping up in some random town in new jersey, projecting the upward housing market value it'd bring. my dad would tell me about all the latest nyc urbanism projects: the highline, seaport south, big island. 

we spent weekends taking the path train into world trade center, back when it wasn't a beautifully ornate marble structure but just a box under construction. 

infrastructure is the invisible undercurrent that drives our society, and 
how to beat:
- shorter feedback loops
- clear signals
- preservered loops

systems include:
- feedback loops
- signals
- decision trees

examples:
- power grid / weather
- air travel / crew scheduling
a blip in a cloud center means that i cant use my laundry app.
cascading airport delays makes a 2 hr flight delayed out to 6 hours.

lately i've been thinking about systems, due to my interest in urbanism / city planning, city infrastructure, and compute infrastructure. 

a system: 
all systems trend towards entropy. the goal of this newsletter is to document the gradual decay of the things we trust as we continue to add strain to their pressure points. 

the slow decay of a system is inevitable. we are all abusing the boxes that have been designed X # of years ago, straining them beyond design. we are all dynamic points in a solar system grid, slowly drifting apart. 

im curious about these questions:
- what are the emergent risks when unknown variables collide? 
- what are the right signals to propagate across different stakeholders to ensure action and proper handoff


i gravitate towards messy problems, unfinished answers.
