i have been having a bad time lately with a lot of careless errors in the past couple of days 
- didnt ask someone for their time off
- read the wrong date in the schedule 
- forgot to ask someone from aice for their availability
- i peeled an orange and dropped it on the street
- i went to bodyrok on the wrong time on sunday
- i brought a skirt and stained it and didnt even wear the skirt 
- i apparently caused the box of my fridge box to malfunction and bun out 
- i suggested to the schie team that they start earlier based on info that the mana update can roll out in parallel and they were quite annoyed 
- forgot to bring my camera to a photo walk
- forgot which time zone a call is in 

prob bc im:
juggling a lot of things - 
- overload from cognitive load, leading to scheduling slips / missed follows up / miscommunication
- mental ram is maxed - brain is reaching for shortcuts
- emotional spillover from escalation 
- fatigue/pressure/perfectionism
- travelled recently to san diego and la 
- low-context switching cost - outpacing my buffer
	- context switching feels natural even when its eroding ur focus


things to do today
- book sf trip
- respond to maje girlie
- prep openrouter 
- start icm
- get ready w doctors thing
