from nitin: you are not necessarily stupid, just more of a type two thinker
**System 2 Thinking:** The slow, effortful, and logical mode in which our brains operate when solving more complicated problems. For example, System 2 thinking is used when looking for a friend in a crowd, parking your vehicle in a tight space, or determining the quality-to-value ratio of your take-out lunch.
