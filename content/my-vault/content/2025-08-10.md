General Idea:
- Build a website that serves as an entrypoint into our creative multi-verse (displaying information, past/upcoming events)
- Future Vision: Empower creatives of NYC to store, share, and display their visual + written work on personal websites that are consolidated into a common feed. Create a flywheel effect where people are incentivized to go to events to develop their own personal portfolio and share it with others.

Explorations:
- Animations of displaying images on the computer 
- Favorite ways of displaying text with image on the screen
