Strong Performance Areas ***Technical & Domain Expertise***: You demonstrated deep knowledge of your current role at Microsoft AI, particularly around GPU infrastructure management and supporting enterprise customers like OpenAI. Your background connecting data science education with product management experience came across clearly. ***Problem-Solving Approach***: The product case study about the internal tool with low adoption showed strong analytical thinking. You correctly identified the need for both quantitative and qualitative analysis, and your decision to focus on the 10% who churned (rather than the 80% who said it didn’t serve their needs) showed good product intuition. ***Leadership Under Pressure***: Your example of the disagree-and-commit situation during the GPU update window was excellent. You clearly articulated how you balanced technical concerns with business constraints and customer impact, making a tough call that prioritized the broader stakeholder needs. ***Relationship Management***: You showed awareness of how to maintain engineering relationships even after difficult decisions, mentioning how you advocate for engineering teams in other contexts to build trust. ## Areas That Landed Well - Your motivation for wanting to work in a constrained, regulated industry (finance) was well-articulated - The personal connection to NYC/Wall Street added authenticity - You showed good self-awareness about Microsoft’s strengths (customer-facing skills, ops excellence) and weaknesses (slower feature delivery, complex partner coordination) - Your questions about Two Sigma’s research-driven culture demonstrated genuine interest and good preparation ## Minor Areas for Future Interviews - You could have been more specific about measurable outcomes from your Microsoft work - The functional specialization question could have been answered more directly (you mentioned data analysis and writing, but could have tied this more explicitly to PM archetypes) ## Overall Assessment The interviewer (Alex) seemed engaged throughout and gave you detailed insights about Two Sigma’s culture and role expectations. His final questions about timeline suggest genuine interest in moving forward. The fact that he mentioned “next week” for follow-up despite noting summer vacations indicates positive momentum. You came across as technically competent, thoughtful about product strategy, and genuinely motivated by the specific challenges of working in financial services. This seems like a strong interview that should advance you to the next round.
Intro
 > “ I’'ve been a TPM at Microsoft AI Infra where I'm driving supercomputing infra for OpenAI’s training and inference workloads — managing reliability, orchestration, and software-driven ops for 5K+ H100/H200 GPUs. Also worked across finance and healthcare enterprises on their workload scheduler strategy. That’s given me deep exposure to how AI infrastructure operates at scale, but also how brittle and complex it is today. I've always found my strength in bridging the technical and the nontechnical, and I love working directly with the customer,  from building dashboards and automations to shipping multi-agent Copilot architectures based on genomics use cases.

Product Sense

imagine u r a pm

At 2 Sigma
Working for internal resources
New internal tool
No context
Gets passed to u 
Adoption is low 
Diagnosing 
Why is it flat


Clarifying Questions
- 

What would u DO to drive and 
- Look at usage
- Talk 
Qualtiative metrics

Focus 
Usage low and flow 
 user interviews


Adoption is low 


Did all that 
User interviews

Out of all 100% one may see 
80% of target audience say tool is not serving their needs
10% say tool is ok 
10% say tool is escatstic

2 hypothetsis

What exactly their needs
learn that 

1. Tool can be improved
2. Fine with the tool 

Can certainly improve 

80% 
10 % 

10% churned

Try to expand the market for tools

Talk about engineers

1. Very technical
	1. Disagree and commit moment
2. Instead 



 Questions:
- biggest needs 
- pms in vertical vs general enterprise
- who are ur users, what r ur metrics, internal tooling 
- would love to know how product strategy unfolds at 2 sigma
	- whether internal tools where your customers are the traders bringing in revenue 
	- or external platforms like venn 
	- how tight is the pm <> dev integration 
- balance between adopting new tech vs compliance
	- esp w copilots and agents how does the vetting process work 
		- at microsft ive seen a lot of financial institutions like banks highly protective of proprietary data which im sure is moreso the case here 
	- influence the decision to build/buy 


> **"How have you seen the PM role evolve as Two Sigma has grown, especially in terms of where PMs are expected to add value — is it more about navigating existing systems, or carving out new ones?"**

> **"In a mature, technically sophisticated org like Two Sigma, how do PMs in Model Engineering or ETFs find meaningful scope, especially when the teams around them are already high-functioning?"**

> “How does the PM role in Model Engineering intersect with this pipeline — especially when balancing support for new alpha models, evolving risk constraints, and ensuring portfolio optimization continues to run reliably?”
