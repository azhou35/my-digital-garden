YOU are the third space
* instead of going to coworking events, build weekly ritual of going to the same coffee shop and having open invites
	* putting your self & your own work as priority over meeting ppl for the sake of meeting ppl
	* no one shows up -- but what about the beauty when someone shows up?
	* reminds me of "standing office hours" for my college project team where i would work in duffieldhall and work on our own thing, but other ppl are invited to pull up and debug tgthr 
	* 2.5 space ?? 4th space ?? personal-shared space??
	* constraints: you prioritize yourself so you choose a coffeeshop near you, and a time convenient for you, and *you show up*
		* i'm very bad at following rituals (like going to church LMAOOO) bc if i dont wanna do something ill just not do it? 
		* maybe - i can pose this open co-writing invite to my friends (saturday @ black fox, perhaps? saturdays @ my place) and detach myself from the expectations of anyone showing up
