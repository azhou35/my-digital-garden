title: "why baseten may"
---

Working within Microsoft's AI infrastructure team, I witnessed a fundamental disconnect: brilliant researchers spending more time wrestling with infrastructure than advancing their science. I saw this firsthand with my sister—an ML professor who spent more time debugging esoteric cloud configurations rather than breakthrough research. This convinced me that AI's next inflection point isn't about better models, but eliminating the deployment gap between innovation and production.

While researching inference platforms for Contrary Research, I discovered Baseten. Testing the platform transported me back to the first time I discovered Jupyter notebooks in high school: the "aha" moment when technical barriers disappeared and I could focus solely on experimentation. That's when I first fell down the AI rabbit hole, which I continued exploring in college through developing Jupyter-native ML tutorials for non-technical audiences at AWS.

Baseten recreates that same friction-free magic for production deployment. What drew me in is how you're building infrastructure specifically for AI workloads rather than retrofitting existing tools. From my experience managing GPU clusters for OpenAI, I've seen how traditional infrastructure breaks down when you're dealing with massive model deployments and inference at scale. The problems AI teams face today didn't exist five years ago, so they need purpose-built solutions, not just bigger versions of old systems.

I want to work where the hardest problems meet the most ambitious people, in an environment that catalyzes growth while investing back into the developer ecosystem. The best platforms don't just serve customers—they strengthen the entire community. Baseten embodies this philosophy through open source contributions like Truss that elevate the entire AI ecosystem. From chatting with team members like Dustin, it's clear the team exhibits that rare combination of technical ambition and human connection, which is exactly where I thrive. I'm excited to bring this experience to help Baseten define the future of AI infrastructure.


Baseten: 

My proudest achievement was building a multi-agent solution that eliminated deployment friction for genomics researchers. In high school, I dreamed of working in biotech. Though I traded pipettes for computers, I stayed connected to this passion at Microsoft by working closely with our genomics research team, who were heavy users of our team's workload scheduler.

This demonstrates exactly who Baseten needs: someone to translate customer insights into product direction, and push hard to align incentives across engineering and GTM folks to deliver for customers. What excites me most remains the same: eliminating friction so customers can focus on breakthrough  innovation instead of deployment complexity.

Walk us through your proudest achievement and how it relates to the role you are applying for.

In high school, I dreamed of being a biotech researcher. Though I traded pipettes for computers, I've always felt connected to genomics work; at Microsoft, I stayed close to our genomics research team, who were heavy users of the workload scheduler my team managed. Despite their deep biotech expertise, I watched  researchers struggle to move from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. As AI agents emerged, I knew I could do something to eliminate barriers preventing high-throughput genomics research in the cloud.

A key question emerged: how could we bring researchers to our HPC infrastructure by removing the technical friction? In lock-step with the genomics team, we prototypes an intelligent orchestration layer that lets researchers describe their needs in plain English and automatically translates that into optimized Azure Batch workflows. This project wasn't just about designing a multi-agent architecture—it was about advocating for a nascent idea and keeping it alive by aligning it with real business needs. Working regularly with business development and their network of potential customers, I built a compelling business case by synthesizing insights from dozens of research teams to guide prioritization and demonstrate clear impact. We piloted a successful Copilot and demonstrated that what used to take researchers weeks now happens in minutes

I was proud to lean on the resources of a large enterprise and drive from start to finish a problem that deeply resonated with me—removing technical barriers and empowering people to innovate. This experience directly maps to what Baseten needs: someone who can bring the market to the product and enable customers to focus on building breakthrough experiments instead of wrestling with deployment complexity. 


The tricky part was synthesizing feedback from 20+ research organizations while coordinating across ML research and engineering teams to actually ship something that worked. But we pulled it off—what used to take weeks now happens in minutes. The system is now accelerating research across multiple organizations, and it perfectly demonstrates how I can own products that span infrastructure, developer experience, and user workflows. That's exactly what drew me to this Baseten role.
