- Lockout/tagout 
- Visual and functional inspections
- Generator startup and running checks
- Final inspections and restoration to AUTO state
- No load Run.During this maintenance, all racks will be dual sourced. Please note that this is an LOR4 PM and is not impacted by the lockdown. The Generator will be locked out for approximately two hours while maintenance is performed. In the event of a utility failure during this period, the cell associated with the locked-out Generator would operate as single sourced until the Generator becomes available again.
