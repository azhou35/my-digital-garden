### How can I pitch a story?

**What we publish:** Every publishes in-depth, long-form writing that offers thoughtful analysis, commentary, unique insights, and actionable advice for the people who build the internet. We approach topics with open curiosity, optimism without being utopian, and fair-mindedness, and aim to deliver criticism with good faith and constructive ideas. We bring an analytical mindset to ideas, and we prize rigor. Our writers draw on their personal experience to deliver earned insights in their singular voices.

We publish the following story formats:

- **Explainers** unpacking big ideas and trends in business, technology, and productivity
- **Analyses** of business strategies and companies
- **How to** do something in work, business, finance, etc.
- **Deep** profiles of industry figures to deconstruct their process and achievements
- **Interviews** with industry figures in business, tech, economics, and finance

**What we look for:** There are three qualities we look for in an Every piece:

- **Is it new?** At Every, we seek to bring our readers ideas that they’ve never seen before. You don’t have to be the first person to ever cover the topic, but it does need to offer a unique perspective or surprising insight.
- **Is it true?** Our stories are grounded in personal experience or backed by facts, anecdotes, interviews, and/or data.
- **Is it useful?** Readers come to Every for ideas and insights they can use to improve their work and their lives. We look for pieces that offer either tactical advice or a new way of thinking about tech or the world.

**How to pitch:** Direct pitches to [hello@every.to](mailto:hello@every.to). Our standard rate is $500 per story. We generally commission stories at 1,500-2,000 words, though we do occasionally go longer. Pitches should include a working title and few brief paragraphs outlining:

- **What your piece will be about.** Be specific: Take us on the journey you want to take readers on in miniature.
- **Why your piece will connect with an audience of people who build the internet.** How is it new, true, and useful?
- **How you prove your argument.** Is it based on personal experience? Is it a reported piece? Will you include data? Analysis from experts?

Along with your pitch, please attach 2-3 examples of past work you’ve done that speaks to an audience of tech operators and builders. If you don’t have writing samples, tell us a bit about why you think you’d be good at it, even if you haven’t done it before.
