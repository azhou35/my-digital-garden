> i think the current issue is that my ideas are too hyperdimensional to convey via short-form text. i need to add dimensionality by using a more complicated medium, like 1) code + design, 2) longer form writing, 

my ideal dimensionality of content is perhaps a social experiment where i ask people questions + generate maps from that? 
map of missed connections:
[Missed Connections New York City | Missed You](https://missedyounyc.com/)
- maybe a good way to use heatmap 
- [Missed Connections New York City | Missed You](https://missedyounyc.com/)
- scrape content and see what things typically show up
- [Penn Station wave - missed connections - craigslist](https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/mis/d/new-york-penn-station-wave/7839964305.html)
- animated so u can watch it rippledacross

what is my *statement of purpose?*
technology serves as a framework that can either uplift or stifle human connection, and i'm interested in how our digital tools both bridge & create distance.

metaphors i'm interested in: digital memory, translation mediums, maps as a means of mapping your internal desires, 
community-building activities: cultural events, writing clubs, writing meetups,

translating philosophical principles into technology:

i'd like to define myself as a social/creative technologists: thoughtful with a bias for action and agency. i want to define myself by short feedback loops and quick action. 


i excel at drawing connections across unrelated ideas.
the role of the writer is just taking the ideas that pop out at you and transcribing them ([[The Role of the Writer]])

i am drawn towards zero to one creation, though i thrive at the idea level and flounder at the execution. i enjoy graphic design & risographs, informative infographics with innovative ways of conveying information. i enjoy information design and how to map sociological questions and patterns onto a visual graphic. i am delighted by data visualizations and the use of data as a democratizing means of storytelling. 

i enjoy hosting things, but i think i get less value out of actually attending the event compared to setting up the framework and vision that enables it to happen. always the director, rather than the actor. 

My writing combines the observational detail of Joan Didion with the technological curiosity of Ted Chiang, seeking to capture both what we've gained and what we've lost in our digital transformation.


I’m going to continue to host pop-ups around the country until I converge on a) a repeatable, profitable process that serves as a concrete proof of concept for the larger project b) Anecdote’s _moat_, or sustainable competitive advantage.

writing publications snippets i enjoy:
"We aim to provide an alternative to the models of experts and academics whose writing is aimed mainly at each other, and of short-form or “explainer” journalism that often fails to engage the deeper questions at stake. Instead, we publish long-form essays, articles, and reports that — we hope — are written with insight, accessibility, literary virtuosity, and factual reliability for lay audiences and scholars alike. Our editors and authors are scientists, medical doctors, engineers, policy analysts, academics, writers, and scholars." - the new atlantic
