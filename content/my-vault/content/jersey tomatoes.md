jersey tomatoes
universal core: 
- ripening as the metaphor for both memory and intimacy
- the ache of something too soon, too late, or perfectly ripe 
	- friends gone too soon 
	- lovers started too soon
- ephemerality of youth & time 
- love is not grand gestures but just someone leaving a piece of fruit 
**opening** 
- sensory memory

**metaphor**
- fruit as intimacy
- emotional armor - pomegranates
- 
**tension**
- ache - fruit that bursts too soon

**resolution**
- love is a willingness to sit thru ones ripening, vulnerability
_“August rain: the best of the summer gone, and the new fall not yet born. The odd uneven time.”_ — Sylvia Plath
_“I have only to break into the tightness of a strawberry, and I see summer – its dust and lowering skies.”_ —

these days all i think about is june. the sticky of salt down my wrist, the sun's wandering eyes. the berries abound on burke-gilman trail & i thirst. pocket gems, how they radiate with desire, beckon of verdant greenery from summer days. so full of themselves, bursting in eagerness to share their immature sweetness. 

we learn timing through fruit. pick it too soon and find bitterness, pursue it too late and it collapses in your hands. friendship and love aren't so different.

summer, she was young, then. an ephemeral happiness that no urban jungle garden can replicate. these days, i get my fruit from whole foods, or maybe instacart delivery. i wonder - were blueberries always this tart? was the weather always this hot? was august always this short? was the sweetness of summer a mere memory? 

**metaphor summer time memory**

we associate this season with new connections: the close friends you make at summer camps and internships, the situations that flame up and flare out. the days are longer, the humidity addles your inhibitions, so you spend borrowed time wholly invested in another soul. you climb mountains together, ride bikes, laze in the river.  

its in the early innings of a connection where you sense someone's natural boundaries and guards. we're really no different from delicate fruit - our insides are fleshy and messy, and wrap it under the emotional armor we show the world.  

some of us are raspberries, tender and exposed. ocean vuong's favorite fruit, so delicate they still need to be hand-harvested. some of us may be pomegranates, an impenetratable shell that harbors secret jewels inside. or consider the stone fruit, a deceivingly delicate disposition with a heart of stone when you dig in.

there's something i term as the permeability of connection: how much do we externalize to the outside work, and how much interiority do we expose? this builds on the idea of *intimacy thresholds*, [intimacy thresholds - by Nix 🕊 - starting from nix ꩜](https://www.startingfromnix.com/p/intimacy-thresholds) 

back then, i was wholly unaware of how much of myself i brought to a burgeoning connection. excited by the prospect of a new friend, i would overwhelm them with my lore - the breakup i was reeling from, the anxieties pressing into me about work and responsibilites, the deep yearning i had for something more. not too unlike a banana, over-ripening in the dark, until it bursts past its skin.  

under the guise of vulnerability there are old friends i will spill myself out to. or maybe, if not invited, the secrets will bubble out from me and reveal themselves in conversation. 

but at the end of the day, you have control over the intimacy you share. and maybe it's a power to diffuse this vulnerability with everyone i meet, and perhaps it's coincidence i meet so many people in the summer time. 

to do: hone in specific examples with friends here 

nostalgia spikes in summer. 

**tension**

there is no proper way of tracking time in this season. there's this false promise of forever you can't control when the peaches ripen, where is the threshold between juices forming and flesh becoming overripe. 

there's no way to track the timeline of a friendship, when you are 100 days away from the last time you'll talk, 50, 25, 1.  every day is just a day until it's the last day before something ends. 

i remember the first summer away from home: summer camp in high school, how endless it felt, how alive the freedom and newness made me feel. 

but i never realized when would be my last summer at home. the summer before: dinners with my parents grilling in the backyard, bike rides around the block with neighbors, farmer market jaunts for the perfect jersey tomato. last time a place felt entirely mine. 

such is the unspoken cruelty of ripening. there's a familiar the ache to a sweetness arriving too soon, too late. we have these false expectations of perfect ripeness, but in reality the sweetness di perfectly ripe 
	- friends gone too soon 
	- lovers started too soon 
summer days end in one of two ways:

either they grow hot and heavy with humidity until they explode under its own tension and pressure

or the hot rapidly dissipates and one day you wake up and it's the fall breeze agian. 

i'd imagine summertime connections are like this. 

i over-exert myself thinking about friendships and timing. that we're moving too fast, too slow, that i'm revealing too much and they too little. 

> I have always been scared of my own ripening

and maybe love is a willingness to peel each other's layers. some people grab you despite the mess of it all. family, close friends. my mom asks how im doing and i start crying. there are people who pierce your tough skin and see you for the fruit that you bear within. 

 hey. maybe connection isn't forever, maybe it isn't some promise of endless summer. maybe under a certain someone's gaze, you ripen a little too quickly. it's that cliche people say, *friends stay for a season or a reason,* that sometimes makes me wanna rip my heart out. 
 
 but what we can offer is there and now, the presence we can offer. 
 isn't grand gestures or promises of forever but the here and now, the presence we can offer. small plates of fruit, clementines exchanged at lunch time. 

forgive me, the mess i reveal of myself at ripening.

berry picking always rings brighter in my mind.

these days all i think about is june. the sticky of salt down my wrist, sun's wandering eyes 
spare words the berries abound on burke-gilman trail & i thirst. pocket gems, how they radiate with desire, beckon of verdant greenery from summer days. so full of themselves, bursting in eagerness to share their immature sweetness. 

summer, she was young, then. persimmons so tender they split themselves.

it is a ephemeral sweetness that no urban jungle garden can cultivate. these days, i get my fruit from whole foods, or maybe instacart delivery. i wonder - were blueberries always this tart? was the weather always this hot? was the sweetness of summer a mere memory? 

watch her pluck blackberries with such gentle, rests her fingers on my face, leaves blue smudges in their trace. i offer a song that sang sweeter in my head— a wish for more brain and less heart. How the peaches of Seattle summer ode to college years she lent me her fingerprints, which i arranged tidy in interconnected touch Blackberries are full of themselves, practically bursting over eager to share their immature sweetness squirrel on floor outstretched palms offer a song that sang sweeter in my head I wish I had more brain and less heart. less sugarplum word, more caustic. in the habit of making myself small magnolia bridges ma found a home upon appetite cease seize appetite

summer, she was young, then. 
overripe fruit 
- persimmons so tender they split themselves 
	- when they're really ripe, osmotic pressure built up by sugar causes the thin skin to burst
- bananas so ripe they burst
- blackberries by the road, so immature in their sweetness 

stone fruit, stone day, in la my sister leaves me a nectarine and i cry at its sweetness. there is something to be said about the bitterness of my whole foods haul, versus the brightness of my family-aged vines. 
i once wrote:
> the berries abound on burke-gilman trail & I am greedy, puncture their young skin before they fully ripen.

> I have always been scared of my own ripening

these days leave me in tears, more often than not. from thinking about friendships to thinking about work to thinking about this abstract person i want to be who i never could. that's the thing about memory, about anchoring yourself to past projections - you only imagine the future in its least-dimensional self, in paper images, and you cannot anticipate what it will actually feel like. 







i once wrote - i wish to my life to be like a fruit 

ocean once wrote his favorite fruit was the raspberry for they are so delicate they need to be picked by hand. 
this summer is distinctly different, than most. 
i have a funny theory that our relationship mirror fruits. 
every relationship is either a soft shell or hard shell fruit
* soft shell, soft inside - fuyu persimmons - burst at the seams
	* aka you make me feel so much and i feel so close to you i will literally overflow with conversation
	* raspberries - the most tender fruit that still needs to be hand-picked
* hard shell, soft inside - pomegranates
	* harder to crack, but when it opens its jolting and surprising 
	* bananas - also burst at the open, but the hard shell makes it mushy and leak out weirdly 
		* regardless of a hard shell, if my feelings are left to rot inside, they will inevitably spill out 
		* i am embarassed when i hold in my emotions too long and they inevitably ooze out 





timing, intimacy, authenticity
