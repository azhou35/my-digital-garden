As a new hire, Kenny guided me through my first cross-functional project by explicitly driving stakeholder alignment early: he helped me identify the key partners to involve, clarify what outcomes we needed agreement on, and set a structure for getting to alignment rather than letting it drift. He also pushed me to define outcomes that would unblock and uplift other teams’ work—for example, ensuring our approach supported Jos’s flex feature—so the project wasn’t just “done,” but useful to downstream partners. Throughout, he coached me on how to communicate tradeoffs and make progress on an unpopular policy change without losing trust.

Right before the break, Kenny quickly scoped the severity of a critical fleet-wide patch and drove clarity in a high-stakes, cross-partner situation (across major cloud/CSP counterparts). He pushed to root-cause what actions were needed and translated that into a concrete execution plan and strategic approach. That work created clear direction and set me up to execute effectively in early 2026.
