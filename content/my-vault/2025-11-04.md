bg in azure maintenance
wanted to make a working doc to where we are at today
- ad hoc pings for 50 nodes at a time
- manual coordination
- internal mental models to remember the states of cluster

and capture the ideal end state 
- at minimum consolidating ingest of maintenance requests whereever possible
- ideal syaye to make them predictable and trackable
- easily socializable to partner teams 

the path to get there
- pushing csps for automations and to the standards other have

req for feedback
