title: "form follows function"
---

and im fascinated by how visual design is informed by the functional use of an item, evolutionary 

i am less interested in design for designs sake
and those that are molded to fit something

e.g. the little finger imprints on japanese pottery
how the plug of a computer cable is three-pronged 
how fashion for construction workers / airline workers / soldiers have evolved for particular purposes

- e.g. jeans for comfort & mobility -> fashion statement 
- carabiners

functional fashion opts for items less for aesthetic reasons but for practical 
but as an intentional chioce ends up becoming a coheisve style
