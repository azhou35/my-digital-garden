title: "i who have never known men"
---

really great book, almost kafka/bradbury-esque but devoutly feminist reading 
author is a little on-the-nose with her insights 
it's a calm book 
even with a tragic premise they never fight for their survival
likely post-apocalyptic world where the colonies of people are kept to survive before the next gas attack
and the alarm happened to strike when the guards were feeding 
so guards abandoned them
only main character of main cage was agentic enough to turn the key 

themes
- isolation / loneliness / companionship
	- main character has no name, has no ties
	- 
- feminine lens 
- survival / meaning in the absurd
	- they leave the cage just to be 'caged' irl 
	- the last remaining girl, laura, just gives up on her life
