title: "object permanence"
---




momentum is a ploy to the senses. 

sitting passenger in a car that screeches to a halt -- your body lurches forward even when the world has stopped.  motion becomes a forcing function for an overthinker who would be otherwise paralyzed in one spot. the past four months i have written myself into standstill, orbited into oblivion, overthought until my own words became overwrought. 

and then a call came, and the rest of dominos fell into motion. a week a decide, a week or so to quit my old job, and another week after that to collapse my comfortable life like a cardboard box. 

in my haste i have allowed myself no time to introspect. there's a lag between the motion around me versus how i've internalized it. 

today i exist within this lag. the body hasn't caught up the mind, obeying the physical laws that governed my previous self. 

it's in the circadian rhythms, where i jolt awake at 6 without fail. a phantom chill that pricks my skin, little hairs that perk in expectation of winter. there are phantoms who walk the street, a mirage where i expect to see people in a space that is instead empty. 

my body rejects the notion of sun in november. i stubbornly wear sweaters and carry around a puffer. 

it is a particular choice to commit to straddle two coasts at a time. friends who travel frequently recommend i buy copies of everything, so to reduce the friction of continuous packing & unpacking. there is the toothbrush to keep in my travel bag and in my rental apartment. i show up to a workout class & realize i forgot my leggings at home, except home is now 2.5k miles away, so i sweat through an inappropriately thick pair of pants and stop by a lulu afterwards. they've changed the composition, so the spandex is one notch tighter, the length just a tad bit too long. 

there is a beautiful pink mug that i bought from the moma design store. it is cheaper to buy a new one than to ship it from my parent's place, so i submit myself the gods of consumerism and click send. twin cups, tied together by some string of symmetry, even when the one at home has a dent in it that cannot be replicated. 

in the 30s, psychologist jean piaget performed a famous test where he shows a toy to a baby, covers it with a cloth, and waits. some don't respond, some look around to find it again. either the object exists in their mind or it doesnt. 

this is known as *object permanence* - the understanding that there is a moment that a child builds an internal representation of the world that is resistance to changes, even if things disappear out of sight. 

unlike a baby, i don't have a development cycle to blame for my lack of permanence. there is nothing concrete to describe my state of my mind - rather i feel like i am floating, apartment to apartment, new friend hang to another. is love still real if it's out of sight? 

do friendships still hold weight when they're a coast away? is the self-hood i meticulously carved in one city transferrable to another?

in literature we are obsessed with the idea of split selves, of doppelgangers in some way. some mickey 17 that allows us to live multiple lives, some sleight of hand to be in two places at once. sometimes i imagine there is an annie in new york beholden to her daily routine, buying an oat milk latte from la cabra and taking the train up to central park for a photo walk. 

in tandem, i sip a cardamom latte from the kantine and journal in the debous triangle. if not me, i pray that at least someone can follow the well-worn path within the life i left behind. 

by the laws of gravity you typically move towards people - this is the first time i've moved away from them. the affection of my mom is distilled into a telephone line. and i cling to this line like a tether, sitting in silence for minutes just to feel the presence of someone on the other side. the group chat explodes when i am at work and dies when i get off work. 

being apart from n feels like cutting my own brain in half. language is insufficient to capture this kind of fracture, so i reach for aphorisms and faith. i return to the monologue at the end of interstellar, the one about *love being the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.*

joan didion once wrote: "*i was in love with New York. I do not mean ‘love’ in any colloquial way, I mean that I was in love with the city, the way you love the first person who ever touches you and you never love anyone quite that way again."* 

i've come to realize that love this intensity is quite singular, and that there is little point in trying to replicate it, whether city or person. perhaps you are less enamored with the *thing* itself, but rather, *who you were/are(?) around that thing.* 

you could only learn to move forward - or to stretch backwards.

in being bicoastal i posture that i am doubling my life. that is a sincere privelige to experience the nature of sf and the bustle of nyc - the focus promised in one coast vs the diversity in the other. 

in practice, my self is split into two, held together by the hazy gossamer of a 6-hour redeye. i wonder if it is really the same self who sleeps in sf and wakes up in ny. do the particles disassemble and coalesce across time zones? do i disappear and re-emerge?  

i trust that i am the same self, even when i haven't written in months, haven't ran, seriously, in a season. tonight i will sleep in rincon hill and dream of brooklyn.

object permanence 


there's this concept of *aliveness,* or the quality without a name, that christopher alexander describes. it's something that cannot be defined but only felt - any building or place that is complete and full. 

in classical cinema we consider the setting as another character, and new york was the star of her own show.

do relationships still hold weight when they're a coast away? is the self-hood i meticulously carved in one city transferrable to another?
