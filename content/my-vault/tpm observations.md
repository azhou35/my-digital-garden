## Sample Problem Scenarios Where TPMs Are Needed

### 1) Reliability Gaps

- Problem: System stability and availability require coordinated improvements across API, infra, and product teams.
- TPM Role: Lead reliability initiatives, conduct reviews, and align fixes across teams.

### 2) Observability Transformation

- Problem: Vendor-based stack is insufficient for real-time insights and cost optimization.
- TPM Role: Design and migrate to first-party stack, integrate AI/ML, and roll out new systems.

### 3) Capacity Constraints

- Problem: Scaling CPU or GPU capacity across regions and workloads has multiple dependencies.
- TPM Role: Build capacity planning runbooks, forecast demand, and coordinate scaling plans.

1. Kickoff Alignment
    - EM, PM, and TPM agree on problem statements, success metrics, and priorities.
    - Identify stakeholders, dependencies, and timelines.
2. Context Transfer
    - Share current plans, dashboards, and historical docs.
    - Walk through recent decisions, technical architecture, and known risks.
3. Integration
    - Add the TPM to planning, standups, and leadership forums.
    - Clarify roles and decision-making authority.
4. Execution Framework
    - TPM drafts initial plan, risk register, and communication cadence for EM or PM sign-off.
5. Feedback Loop
    - Set regular checkpoints to ensure alignment and address blockers.
- ## Exit Criteria

Signals for disengagement

- Critical risks mitigated
- Sustaining owner identified and onboarded
- Success metrics met consistently
