- Modern data-center construction began in the nineties, with the arrival of the
commercial internet. Data centers hosted websites, coördinated e-mail, processed
payments, and streamed video and music. Amazon was particularly aggressive
about building data centers—so many were constructed in Loudoun County,
Virginia, that the area became known as Data Center Alley. Even before the A.I.
boom, data centers were profitable; in some years, Amazon’s web-services division
earned more than the company’s retail operation, on a fraction of the sales.
- This summer,I visited a CoreWeave facility on the outskirts of Las Vegas.The
building, a large warehouse, was surrounded by a thick fence and dotted at regular

a security guard wearing a bulletproof vest and a holstered Taser. After
surrendering my phone,I took two lime-green earplugs from a dispenser and
entered the facility.
- The nodes in question were shallow trays of computing equipment, each weighing
around seventy pounds and holding four water-cooled G.P.U.s along with an array
of additional gear. Eighteen of these trays are stacked, then connected with cables
to a control unit, to form the Nvidia GB300 computing rack, which is a little
taller than a refrigerator and costs a few million dollars.In a busy year, a typical
rack will use more electricity than a hundred homes. Dozens of them stretched
into the distance.
- wondered.“I was told
by H.R. that I can’t ask this kind of question anymore, but I like to hire people

thing.”

saying,I nodded sagely, as if in a conversation at a night club. Even with the plugs
in, my ears were starting to ring, and I was developing a headache.


- me.“Here, you have somebody get in with a
thumb drive, and it can fit the entirety of OpenAI’s I.P. on it.”
