i am delighted by humans above all. 

for my birthday i drew menus and made stickers and prepared matcha the night before.

i'd pin my friends as all generous, but that isn't a specific enough word. they share a genorosity of their time, which is so much more capped than monetary value. 

its the way michelle made cookie batter the night before and came early to blow up balloons. shirling waking up at 9 to make a cake adorned with flowers kristie bringing her cam everywhere. it's the way justin started quietly cleaning up the finished cake plates and drink cups. gary whipped out his heavy-weight sony and snapped away. how when it came time to cut the cake, there were four cameras of different fidelities to look at. 

generosity of time is a quality you cannot optimize: but the core of friendship is a mutual buy-in from both parties. it's an inherent social contract that you will invest in each other and you will allocate some of your precious time thinking about them. it's saying *let me help you with this* and helping with small tasks at a house party. it's michelle and ruthie inviting telling annie about their run and immediately inviting her to run with them. 

around the end bahar went up to me and commented how lovely it was that everyone was so easy to get along with and that its really a reflection of whos in my life.


humans, they frustrate me and delight me all at the same time. perhaps that is what love is.
