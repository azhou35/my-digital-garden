title: "i hate the sound of my own voice."
---

the way it comes back from the recording, distorted, high pitched.
the way it cracks and splinters in the face of conflict and emotion. 
the way it buzzes in my own head, screaming at every wrong decision and what if. 

sometimes it feels easier to stay silent. keep it tucked inside of me, self-soothe in fearful anticipation of taking up too much space. 

yet—

i love my voice. as my poetry teacher once put it, i abound with "dense kernels of sound, tumbling rhythms, tumbling rhythms." i laugh with my mouth open.
