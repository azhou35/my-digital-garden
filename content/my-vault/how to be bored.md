title: "how to be bored"
---

thesis: in stillness you train your ability to observe 
**analysis**
	- as someone who seeks novelty - nature is a necessary shock to my system
	- i often wonder how poets come from the most boring of places in middle america 
		- to writing glorious pieces about the everyday 
		- like ada limon and the plume of birds
		- mary oliver
			- industrious hummingbirds, egrets, motionless ponds, “lean owls / hunkering with their lamp-eyes
			-  “stands quite comfortably on the margins of things, on the line between earth and sky, the thin membrane that separates human from what we loosely call animal.
	- as someone who's glued to their notifications and heartbeat is fine-tuned to slack - disconnect 
**narrative**
- prospect park - absolute stillness
		- let yourself get bored -> vacation 
	- late november and the foreboding chill 
		- the false warmth promised by sunset 
		- everything brightens in a soft glow 
		- sun sinking into the skyline like a separating egg yolk
		- juicy and fleeting
	- the park has some remaining grass left 
	- where people dress for function such that it dictates form
		- the bright pop of an orange beanie 
		- the well-fitting cropped jeans 
		- the blundstones 
	- we walk by a waterfall 
		- idle hands
- on a walk in edgewater the sky is a muted grey blue. there is a blue tint even to the foiliage's remaiqning orange plume. 
- a friend and i agree we're glad we grew up in suburban nowheres rather than anywhere too lit 
	- w no distractions we were compelled to make our own narratives
	- i wrote so many cringe poems about culdesacs, fireflies, target parking lots 
- instead of trying out new places we go on
	- long walks
	- share silences
- attention
	- how people choose what to read, watch, notice

"The most interesting people I know grew up in places where nothing happened, and boredom forced them to invent things worth noticing."

> **Most of us don’t want more things. We just want to actually feel the life we already have.**
> **All we really want is to feel awake in our own lives.**

**current state**

friday night, i log off work. slack notifs still spam my inbox but i peel yourself away for the night you've jam-packed. the latest restaurant opening, then drinks at a cocktail bar, then you find yourself engulfed in lights at a music hall and lose yourself within the music. 

i am hungry for new experiences, to see more interesting things and become an interesting person who does interesting things. i desire novelty now. classic city dweller, chasing the latest restaurant opening or new movie release. but i fear my attention going out of control. 

**go on a walk**

the air is chilly and it's stick season, the trees as tall lines jutting into the sky. the muted orange plume against slate grey. i imagine there's a different kind of beauty, when you're looking at dead trees, that emerges and calls to you. the pre-december chill is sharp, and this bite helps my mind sharpen. i never felt more sharp than walking in the park. 
 
i keep noticing things. i wonder out loud if this is why some of the greatest poets come from the most middlest of americas -

its the same way you dont just feed a baby a flavor bomb - you fed them veggies.
going back to observe the small details after a weekend in the city feels like eating organic food after preservered snacks. sure the former is not as flavorful but its natural and feels sustainable. it's the same reason why we eat our vegetables/fruits . 

**noise**

consumption 

**boredom**

i remember talking to b about how we grew up, in suburban towns in nj and florida. we agree that we're grateful to have grown up bored - that at the time all i ever wanted to do was escape the world i knew within these four walls, run past the forest of scant trees. the strip malls, the bagel worlds.

there's this trend on tik tok where kids take an image of their deadbeat town and compare it to some exotic location - like japan or italy. its in this absurd retelling that we are feeding beauty back into our worlds. 

in a college slam poetry class they tasked us to write about our hometown. all i could produce about my lived experience was tired prose about the cul-de-sacs and the fireflies. i was jealous of the kids who grew up in areas of extremes - cities and nature - these kids who grew up in cities must have so many stories to share. moving to the city felt like a natural answer. 

we think money and movement is the answer. when i feel bored, my fingers tingle to click a "buy" button: pick up that new sweater, go to new restaurants, book that trip. 

but the truth is - > **Most of us don’t want more things. We just want to actually feel the life we already have.**

it is easier to book a flight than to appreciate the very grass that we wake up to everyday.



**seeing and attention**
(insert paterson)
Jim Jarmusch — Paterson (2016)

it's a film about a bus driver in new jersey and follows his weekly route, as he writes poetry about cups of coffee, rain, and conversations. 

an environment that was boring for me is gold for someone who's trained their attention. i practice this on my commute, attuned to th e

our sense of sight is one of our core truths, and the ability to tune it is one of our early skills. 

annie dillard once said - > _“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”_ 

i'm mindful i sound like any tech word discouraged by the system, who wants to escape into the wilderness and retreat into homemaking. i want to spend my life in this fantasy, live-culturing butter and picking mushrooms from the ground. 

but we don't actually want to throw our lives away in pursuit of the wilderness. what we need to do is wake up in the life we're living. 

how to train attention ->
- photography/poetry/art

"So ask yourself this: when was the last time you let your mind get quiet enough to actually notice what you want?"

why do we want to reclaim our attention? because letting it go removes our agency. *to* us rather than we *obesrve* things



it's one of those
it's stick season 


**meaning and purpose**

There is infinite distraction. But it's time to take control over your attention.
