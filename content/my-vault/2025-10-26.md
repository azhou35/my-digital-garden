### Log 
i am feeling a little squishy these days

ideal workflow in the morning:
- every meeting start a notion page
- every morning look at tasks, create new ones, prioritize certain ones 
- tag tasks to projects
saw ka, cirque de soleil and was amazed by the prowress of the stage

- Employees who work remotely full-time or choose to purchase ergonomic equipment outside of the recommended options may request a **one-time reimbursement of up to $200 USD / £150 GBP / €170 EUR** through Navan, after completing an ergonomic assessment. Costs beyond that are the employee’s responsibility. To be reimbursed, submit your **receipt** and **ergonomic assessment report**, and select the expense type **“Ergonomic Equipment.”**
    
    - If you have a documented medical need, you may be eligible for an exception. Please contact [ehs@openai.com](mailto:ehs@openai.com) to discuss.
        
    - **Remote contract workers** are **not** eligible for the $200 reimbursement. OpenAI does not cover home office setup costs; however, our Ergonomics team can provide equipment recommendations.
