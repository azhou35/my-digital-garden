Every Product Studio (Part-time, flexible, remote)

We’re looking for a conscientious, curious, and kind human to help us take care of our users across the Product Studio at Every—including tools like Cora, Sparkle, and Spiral.

#### You’d be our go-to person for:

Staying on top of our support inbox and Featurebase, making sure users feel heard (and helped!)

Building out our community of users and becoming the face of the Studio in our online user communities. Getting to know users and building relationships

Anticipating questions before they come up and responding with clarity

Occasionally hopping on Zoom calls with users to learn more about how they use our tools and their experience

Surfacing recurring issues or friction points so you can turn them into great help docs and build with the user in mind

Being a calm, steady voice in our user experience—someone who enjoys helping people and making things better

#### This role is perfect for someone who’s:

Naturally responsive and organized (you’re on top of your own inbox, and can help wrangle user questions and feedback)
