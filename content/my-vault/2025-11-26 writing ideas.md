title: "2025-11-26 writing ideas"

substack reflection
my persona is the “the thoughtful, hyper-perceptive narrator who connects dots others miss” 
-> orient myself more into the emotional
rather than intellectualizing the emotionals
i focus more on imagery and details rather than the story itself
i think my thing is i dont cut enough in my writing

persimmons and promises 
the flash of orange on the watch
feeling resonance with the others at zulan concert
mercenearies

### feedback 
narrate from within the voice
im protecting myself in the prose with overanalysis
am i writing with too much passive voice? 
connie tells me my writing is actually not that personal
how do i get better at dropping into the moment without metacommentary?

### ideas
- the cost of being high functioning 
	- i like being busy and multi tasking and doing a million things at once so i can drown out the noise in my brain
- how to be bored
	- sit still with empty space on a gcal
- how to chill out 
- momentum [[2025 reflection]]
	- **this should be my 2025 piece**
		- i did things bc i could
		- i hosted that photo gallery, reached out to that chef, 
		- and i was relentless about job search. cold-dm'ed endlessly into a job. 
	- I’m terrified of slowing down because I don’t know who I’ll be when the momentum stops.
	- constantly optimizing for a local maxima
	- a friend who moved from the heart of manhattan to brooklyn comments how much she enjoys her local coffee shop, she can go to time and time again. 
		- when does novelty wear off -> compounding gains kick in?
	- la cabra multiple times 
	- motion > feeling
- friendship logistics
	- how to walk away from friends 
	- when did it get so hard
	- and how things die in the group chat 
	- Spending two hours trying to pick the perfect birthday gift, only to buy nothing because the options overwhelmed you.
- a study in orange
	- in high school someone told me that male accessories are what carried the outfit. he was obsessed with the color orange
- being particular
- radical optimism
	- 1. The future can be great
	1. People’s intentions are mostly good
		1. good faith

			2. another way of saying lucky girl syndrome which is that people are generally good actors
		2. examples
			1. ppl picking me up when i fall
			2. strangers telling me my tag was still on
		3. people are good if you align with their intentions 
			1. internal/external locus
		4. the good place 
	2. Ideas are fragile and need nurturing
		1. how to nurture an idea
1. cognitive biases - ppl are generally hackable

	- fountain pens / digi cams / journalling

scenes from past couple weeks 
- sitting on floor, luggage open, kissing a cat

- walking up and down the hills of sf 
- making food with family -> being fed and taken care of 
- walking down edgewater 
	- slate grey, muted brown

	- as someone who seeks novelty 
	- i often wonder how poets come from the most boring of places in middle america 
	- on a walk in edgewater the sky is a muted grey blue. there is a blue tint even to the foiliage's remaining orange plume. 
	- prospect park we walk by a waterfall
