BeReal is the post-pandemic answer to ambient noise 

Platform social medias—the likes of Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram—have become bloated with features to the point of sensory overload. So it's not wonder that a little French app with an addictive gimmick has risen to the top of the app store.

BeReal is a fairly barebones with only a few hard-set rules: at a random time, a notification alerts users to take a picture of whatever they're doing in the moment (back and front camera included). And the next notification resets the pictures from the previous day, meaning that every profile starts with a clean slate. 

I've picked up BeReal in January 2022, around the same time I deleted my personal Instagram. With my Facebook essentially a graveyard and Twitter a secluded corner, that left BeReal as my remaining passive communication with old hometown friends & college homies who I can't see on the daily. It eschews the deceptive design & sociological patterns intimate to aforementioned popular apps; there's no infinite scroll, nor pressure to accumulate likes or followers. And especially resistant of the creator economy trend, BeReal circumvents the "influencer" persona by focusing on first-degree networks. At the same time, I'm hesitant to buy into the fanatic fervor for BeReal, having seen many gimmicky anti-Instagram concepts either sizzle out or turn into their worst enemy to the tune of monetization.
