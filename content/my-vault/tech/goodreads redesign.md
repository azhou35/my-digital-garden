title: "goodreads redesign"
---

* problems:
  * as an avid reader disconnected from my friends its hard for me to maintain digital book clubs	
    * scheduling issues
    * remembering the book we discussed
  * as a poetry lover its hard for me to find fellow poetry lovers online
  * im reading too many books at once
  * difficult to discuss think pieces together
    * finding ppl interested -> sending them article -> reading it / dissecting it together
* ideas:
  * feature to sync up reading amongst devices
  * accountability tracker (nudge ppl to read)
  * find other ppl reading same book as u to chat
  * creating a book club with other people
  * recommending books based on someone’s book tastes 
  * discovery for new books
