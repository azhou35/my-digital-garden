*how to remain grateful in the world and move as if there are no barriers*

i think its easy to default to cynicism in the world. 

your daily commute - you take a swig of your coffee and meet acrid bitterness, and you curse the barista who fucked up your order. your boss reroutes you on the project  you were working on for a long time. 

then there's the meta - that you're stuck in your 9-5 forever, that the commute sucks, that rent is too high. 

that everyone is out to get you - your boss, that random person who swerved you on the street, your barista who messed up your coffee order 

i practice good faith
1. good faith 
	1. i get irrationally angry on the streets sometime. when a car jerks into my right of way 
	2. another way of saying lucky girl syndrome which is that people are generally good actors
2. examples
	1. ppl picking me up when i fall
	2. strangers telling me my tag was still on
3. people are good if you align with their intentions 
	1. internal/external locus
4. the good place
